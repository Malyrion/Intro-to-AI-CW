(Holiday note: We usually respond within 24 hours but are taking a break at the end of December 2021. Expect a response in early January.)
Lindus Health is looking for a software engineer (full-stack engineer, backend engineer or frontend engineer) to build the platform powering the next generation of clinical trials. Join a small team in the early stages of product development and grow your skills as we scale the product to manage complex trials and bring new treatments to patients faster!
About us
Clinical trials are in crisis. The industry hasn't changed in 30 years, and the cost of bringing new medicines to market is skyrocketing as a result.
Lindus Health’s mission is to fix this. We accelerate clinical trials, so patients can benefit. We’re building the world’s first full stack clinical trial platform, to conduct faster, safer clinical trials on behalf of companies developing new treatments, and lowering the barriers to participation for patients.
Since launching the company in March 2021 we have helped find over 5,000 patients for more than 25 clinical trials in areas like type 2 diabetes, COVID-19 diagnostics and mental health. We closed a $5m seed round to grow our platform and team.

About you
Our wish list for this role looks something like this:
You have 2 years or more experience as a software engineer collaborating in a team
You’re a full-stack engineer, or you specialize in backend or frontend development - at this point we have a need for both generalists and specialists. Backend: You have some experience with Python/Django or similar frameworks (e.g., Flask, Ruby on Rails, Node/Express). Frontend: You have some experience with a modern client framework (e.g., React, Vue, Ember).
You are product-minded: you want to understand why we are building something to figure out the best how in collaboration with product managers, UX designers and users.
You want to be a part of building a new team and new products from scratch. You like an early-stage startup environment where you have autonomy and opportunities to grow in all areas that interest you.
You belong here! If your experience and interests match with some of the above, we want you to apply.

What will you do?
In your first month:
Learn about clinical trials and the problems we are trying to solve from our co-founders, medical lead and trial managers
Collaborate with the product team on a starter project, make your first commits and your first deploys
Become familiar with the core components of our stack (React, TypeScript, Django, Python, Postgres, Amazon ECS)
In your first 3 months:
Become a part of the regular product development cycle where you work for example on features to collect data from trial participants and to help trial staff keep track of progress
Observe the product being used in real trials and support the team in responding to feature requests and bug reports
Within your first year:
Take on responsibility for substantial new features and facilitate related architecture and design decisions
Shape our engineering practices and work on making the team more productive in areas such as testing, CI, deployment pipelines, cloud architecture
Help grow the product & engineering team by interviewing candidates, onboarding new hires and possibly mentoring junior engineers
What we offer
Base salary based on experience in the range £55K to £80K, plus 0.1% - 0.3% stock options
Unlimited holidays; everyone is encouraged to take off at least 28 days each year
Flexible office arrangement; come into the office in London (near Victoria station) as often as you like, or work remotely (within the UK)
Monthly team events and days out (pandemic permitting); recently we've been to Legoland, and a Millwall FC home game (decided by popular vote)
If working mostly remotely: regular all-expenses paid trips to London to see the whole team (pandemic permitting)
Up to £500 towards setting up your home office
A new laptop as your main workstation
UK visa sponsorship if you’re not already eligible to work in the UK
Our technology strategy
Collaboration rocks. We like processes that emphasize openness and knowledge sharing across disciplines, across hierarchies and across time. We acknowledge that sharing, discussing and documenting their work means a certain amount of overhead for individuals, but this is more than offset in the long run by a culture of healthy teams and individual growth.
Iterate with abandon. We recognize that we often don’t know what the heck we’re doing when we start working on a new feature or technical problem, but we know that our understanding will improve as we start down a path to a particular solution. We favor tools and processes that support rapid iteration and frequent validation through user feedback and metrics.
Favor boring technology. We choose languages, frameworks, libraries, architectures and tools that are well-established in order to focus on the part that's hard and exciting and accelerates clinical trials the most: product development. We like a mature technology that has been around for at least a decade with abundant documentation and a large community around it. We deviate from this norm in targeted areas of innovation relevant to the business.
Related reading: Boring Technology (Dan McKinley), Buy vs build (Camille Fournier)
Test in production. We recognize that the last steps of integration and productionization of a new feature are hard - often harder than writing the code in the first place. We favor tools and processes that let us deploy to production early and often and as confidently as possible. We believe that deep insight into how their code behaves with real data and real users is crucial for engineers to get better at their craft.

Our hiring process for engineers
Send your resume to jobs@lindushealth.com. We welcome all applicants regardless of gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, religion, civil or family status, age, disability, or race. If Lindus Health’s mission resonates with you, we want you to apply! We commit to responding to you within 24 hours (weekends and holidays excepted).
Initial call with a co-founder (30 minutes): This is your opportunity to learn more about Lindus Health. We want to tell you about our mission and what we're doing to revolutionise health research.
Technical discussion with Nik, our CTO and a co-founder (90 minutes): This is a session in two parts where we figure out whether your technical skills mesh with our team. We deliberately don’t demand you write code or solve algorithm puzzles in real time, though you have the option to do a coding challenge at your own pace if you like.
Part 1: Code. You can choose between talking about a piece of code you’ve already written or complete a coding challenge at home that we then talk about. In the first option, you share a piece of your code that you think is interesting. We will walk through the code together and discuss your thought process, challenges you’ve faced and potential refactorings. If you choose the second option you get instructions for a coding challenge that you can do at your own pace ahead of the discussion. The challenge is designed to take no more than 2 hours to complete.
Part 2: Architecture & practices. We will share a document with you in advance that explains our team’s current architecture choices and practices. We will discuss what appeals to you about it, what you would change and what you would add to it. As an early team member you will have a real say in evolving this.
Values interview (45 minutes): This is a conversation with 1 or 2 co-founders about our values and culture and also your chance to ask any questions you still have about Lindus Health.
Meeting the team (one or two calls of 30 mins, or an in-person meeting if you’re in London): At this stage you’ll want to get to know more of the people you’ll be working with. We’ll set up informal calls or meet you in person at our office near Victoria station in London.
Offer! If you've come this far, receive an offer and join the team to help us bring about the next generation of healthcare research. We move fast and usually make a decision within hours of your last meeting."

Kafka for our asynchronous message queue.
React for internal web dashboards.","At Monzo we're aiming to build the best current account in the world. We are always keen to hear from capable, creative engineers who want to help us accomplish that goal
Our backend engineers have a variety of different backgrounds
We have several non-graduates; only some of us studied Computer Science; one of the team has a degree in Marketing; some of us have worked in huge companies; some have only ever worked in startups; others are former consultants. As long as you enjoy learning new things, we'd love to talk to you. We do not ask for formal qualifications or degree requirements for any of our engineering roles.
We are actively creating an equitable environment for all of our engineers to thrive
Diversity and inclusion are a priority for us and we are making sure we have lots of support for all of our people to grow at Monzo. We provide a sponsorship framework in Engineering for women and people of colour; all of our leaders are trained on privilege awareness and we are creating partnerships with organisations dedicated to supporting underrepresented groups. You can read more in our 2020 Diversity and Inclusion report.
We encourage an open and transparent working environment
You can get involved in any aspect of the business you are interested in and, following Stripe's example, all emails in the company are visible in an email archive. We contribute to open source software as much as possible. Our blog is a good place to learn even more about what we do!
Monzo works in project-based sprints in small, interdisciplinary teams
We have around 150 engineers out of roughly 1,400 people in total - and we have big ambitions. There are many interesting challenges ahead, and we're happy for people to move between teams or to specialise, whatever you prefer. As an engineer here you'd be able to work directly with anyone across the company, and we run regular knowledge-sharing sessions so you'll learn heaps about everything from how banks work to effective communication.
At Monzo you will get to work with a lot of exciting new technology.
We rely heavily on the following tools and technologies:
Go to write our application code (there's an excellent interactive Go tutorial here)
Cassandra for most persistent data storage
Kafka for our asynchronous message queue
Envoy Proxy for RPC
Kubernetes and Docker to schedule and run our services (Oliver, our VP Architecture, gave a great talk at KubeCon on how we use these technologies)
AWS for most of our infrastructure
React for internal web dashboards
We also have two physical datacenter sites with actual cables to connect to various third parties
Our product squads are truly cross-functional.
This role is all about collaborating across disciplines to test hypotheses and make a difference to customers. As a product backend engineer you'll work in a squad alongside product managers, marketers, user researchers, designers, mobile engineers, web engineers, data analysts, business analysts, writers and more!
Together you'll build and support a particular part of Monzo. Our product squads belong to one of four collectives (a word we use to describe self-governing business units of ~100 people). They are: Growth & Core, Borrowing, Operations and Money. They're all looking for additional Backend Engineers right now.
The Growth & Core collective helps people to discover Monzo and make the most of it.
Growth & Core is a collective focused on different aspects of our mission to 'make money work for everyone' and it has four squads. They make users effortlessly financially savvy with features like Budgeting, Pots and the Salary Sorter. Many of the customer problems they solve are revenue opportunities, too – like Monzo Plus, Business Banking, and the Savings marketplace. Last year they also launched our Open Banking APIs, shipped a simpler and more future-proof navigation structure, and enabled Monzo customers to get their salary paid a day early for free!
The Borrowing collective makes borrowing money simple, fair and transparent.
We're really proud that this fair approach to lending helps people to get what they want from life on their own terms. Squads in Borrowing have already shipped and scaled overdrafts to hundreds of thousands of Monzo customers. They've made it easy to take out a loan without the unfair fees or confusing pricing that you find elsewhere. They work on everything from the way borrowing works in the app, right down to how they move and account for money that our customers borrow. One of the most interesting problems they face is deciding how much to lend and to whom. The team believes that they can make access to credit fairer and more transparent.
The Operations collective is responsible for our incredible customer support.
The Operations collective looks after one of the most interesting problem spaces at Monzo: as we grow, we want to ensure that we're using technology as effectively as possible whilst still maintaining customer service so good that you want to tell your friends. Our engineers within this area of the business help us to explore these challenges. Central to it all is Monzo Chat – a completely bespoke bit of software we've built from the ground up to manage chats in our app - but we're also doing work with machine learning, and looking at how technology can more broadly support our wonderful support team (we call them COps) in other aspects.
The Money collective helps Monzo move fast and in control with our money
We are the bank within the bank and are responsible for the core infrastructure and banking services you associate with Monzo. We are the Guardians of the Monzo Ledger and own everything related to our distinctive Hot Coral cards.
Engineering squads within the Money collective carry out a variety of payments and finance related work, we built our very own Mastercard processor from scratch and recently we successfully replaced a third-party Faster Payments Gateway with our own internal Gateway to reduce outages we can't control. On top of this we've been ensuring our payment schemes are compliant with key regulatory requirements such as Strong Customer Authentication (SCA), 3D Secure V2 (3DSV2), making sure that our core infrastructure and services will scale to support our ambitious growth plans and that we always know where our money is and can report accurately and reliably on it.
The financial crime at Monzo team focuses on making sure our services are a hostile environment for criminals
We tackle all financial crime together as one team, this includes money laundering, fraud, sanctions breaches, terrorist financing, bribery and corruption and tax evasion. Engineers get to work on core services that are consumed by many different products which means we have a really broad perspective. We've had some major successes in combating financial crime, most famously The Ticketmaster Breach where we spotted large-scale fraudulent activity due to a Ticketmaster data breach before Ticketmaster or other banks did.
The TechOps team
The TechOps team are challenging the traditional IT model by building a brand new people platform to automate all aspects of a Monzo staff member's time here. We're building an industry leading people platform to support our staff in a delightful way and to accommodate rapid growth across multiple countries. This approach will allow us to empower our staff by providing smart, efficient and powerful tools instead of relying on traditional IT systems and a horde of IT staff.
You should apply if
Our open roles are for mid-level to senior Backend Engineers at present.

you have strong experience working on the backend of a technology product
you think you'd enjoy the kind of work we're doing
you want to be involved in building a product that you (and the people you know) use every day
you have a product mindset: you care about customer outcomes and you want to make data-informed decisions
you're comfortable working in a team that deals with ambiguity
you're interested in distributed systems and writing resilient software
you have some experience with strongly-typed languages (Go, Java, C, Scala etc.).
Logistics
Salary is around £90,000 - £116,000 plus stock options and other benefits.
We can help you relocate to London & we can sponsor visas.
This role can be based in our London office, but we're open to distributed working (with ad hoc meetings in London once COVID is over).
We're usually always hiring for Backend Engineers, so there's no closing date for this job.
We offer flexible working hours and trust you to work enough hours to do your job well, at times that suit you and your team.
Diversity and inclusion is a priority for us – if we want to solve problems for people around the world, our team has to represent our customers. So we need to attract the best talent and create an environment that supports and includes them. You can read more about diversity and inclusion on our blog.
If you prefer to work part-time, we'll make this happen whenever we can - whether this is to help you meet other commitments or strike a great work-life balance.
Our interview process is normally a phone interview, a coding task and call to discuss it, and 2-3 hours of onsite interviews that can be conducted via hangouts as well. We promise not to ask you any brain teasers or trick questions. We might design a system together on a whiteboard, the same way we often work together, but we won't make you write code on one.
Equal Opportunity Statement
At Monzo, embracing diversity in all of its forms and fostering an inclusive environment for all people to do the best work of their lives with us. This is integral to our mission of making money work for everyone.
We're an equal opportunity employer. All applicants will be considered for employment without attention to ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, family or parental status, national origin, veteran, neurodiversity status or disability status.

Specifically, we want to build a new, structured way for businesses to make and agree contracts by replacing the outdated Microsoft Word workflow with a browser-based, visual contract building application that will empower anyone to create a world class contract without a lawyer. Just like Figma has democratised design tools, and WebFlow has democratised website development, we want to give business owners, HR teams, procurement teams and in-house lawyers all over the world the ability to create and negotiate any business contract by combining legal, design, software and machine learning expertise.

The Role
You will help us build software that will allow our customers to create contracts from a library of templates, and quickly review and edit contracts sent to them by counter-parties. You’ll also help us develop our machine learning service which can automatically edit contracts and explain the changes to the user in plain English. And you’ll help us build an intelligent contract repository that will help companies save thousands of hours searching for information trapped inside their contracts. We’ve already made great progress towards this product vision, but you will play a pivotal role in making it a reality.
Tech Stack
Our frontend is built using React and Apollo, and we use Python web frameworks, such as Django and Flask, to implement our back-end services, alongside various other services and libraries such as Celery and Elasticsearch. Everything runs on AWS services, including but not limited to ECS, Lambda and SQS. We use CircleCI to build and deploy, and all of our infrastructure is managed using Terraform.
Responsibilities
Develop back-end services and API’s using Django and similar Python frameworks;
Build and maintain the Infrastructure our products and components are deployed to;
Write high quality, well tested code that solves challenging problems;
Identify and prioritise tasks, taking into account company objectives and goals.
Your Skills
You enjoy working across the stack, and have experience with Python frameworks such as Django and Flask, and Cloud Infrastructure (e.g. AWS)
Have a background working in a start-up or similar size organisation and are passionate about building high quality products
Have an in-depth understanding of the entire development process (design, development and deployment)

You will enjoy working in a stimulating, diverse and intellectually challenging environment where collaboration is essential to achieving results. You should have at least two years experience working in an engineering team and be confident managing your own schedule while achieving measurable results. Experience working with Machine Learning/Data science models isn’t a pre-requisite, but it is a bonus – so let us know if you’ve worked in the space or have an interest in it.

Why Sigma Labs?
There are loads of companies that look like us: FDM, Sparta, Futureproof, Digital Futures, Kubrick, Xandertalent, M3, QA, etc. all promise pretty much the same thing: 6 to 12 week technical training (free), then hopefully a 2 year job with a salary between £21k and £30k working with one of their clients (and if you leave in that period you have to pay back the cost of the training, usually £10k to £20k);
So why us?
Judge us by what we say and do: start with how many companies tell you about their competitors;
We are a start-up education b-corp that invests in people through world class training: this does not mean we’ll teach you what you want to learn, for example if you dead set on only being a ‘full stack java developer’, then we’re probably not right for you. We focus on technology consultants (primarily teaching software & data engineering but covering a large number of roles from software development to test engineers). In addition we cover high performance professional skills (based on the Bain graduate programme) that will enable you to excel longer terms. As you excel, our clients excel and we recover the cost of the training.
We have worked at and our investors come from some of the world’s most renowned companies, from BCG & McKinsey to Unilever, The Guardian and Google. We are all driven by interested in high performance;
What we offer?
The Training: a free 12 to 16 week intense programme covering software & data engineering: from JavaScript, SQL and Python to industry best practices (OOP, TDD & Agile). As important is the training in high performance personal & professional behaviour (from interviewing to problem solving);
The Role: after the training our laser focus is to find you a client and employ you on a £30,000 salary. You’ll work with our clients for 2 years helping them solve real world problems, while we continue to develop you technically & professionally. If we fail to find you a role with us, we’ll still try and help you find a role somewhere;
The Goal: at the end of the 2 years working for us, you'll join our network: >100 senior managers at some of the world's leading organisations, all committed to help Sigma Labs alumni long term. You should be able to earn £40k+ at this point.
What we're looking for?
The key is not the subject but that you do these things yourself. This is how you would honestly describe yourself:
A Problem Solver: logical, mathematical, scientific, philosophical, human….you name it;
A Good Communicator: this doesn’t mean charisma. You put effort into being understood;
Conscientious: you like doing great work for other people - a combination of ambition & niceness;
Curious: you’re interested in things - from coding to plants or languages to crypto;
Persistent: you don’t get phased by problems. You know to break them down, not give up and learn.
Eligibility Criteria: you must have…
Economic: at least one of the following: grown up in a household with income < £43k, attended a non-academically selective state school, been eligible for free school meals or local authority care;
Education:
2:2 or higher (the subject isn’t important but you’re comfortable with numbers); or if you didn’t get a 2:2 or higher but still graduated, then you received at least an A or B in one STEM subject. We need to know that you’re ok with numbers and enjoy solving problems;
Right to work in the UK: UK Passport, EU/EEA Settled Status, Indefinite Leave to Remain (unfortunately we cannot sponsor Visas).
Location: the training will be predominantly online but we will also invite you to our London office at times as face-to-face interactions are difficult to beat.
The Application Process: Apply for our March 2022 or July 2022 cohort now! We provide clear tips on how to do well on the application but you can also easily book a quick call if you’d like to find out more. Please note that applications are considered on a first-come first-serve basis.

We are always keen to hear from capable, creative engineers who want to help us accomplish that goal
We're currently looking for Senior Backend Engineers to join our Platform team.
We're looking for engineers with experience working with Platforms who are software engineers at heart - you're as comfortable writing software to solve problems as you are operating AWS or Kubernetes. If you're a software engineer who has some good cloud infrastructure experience already, or you're eager to get really familiar with systems, tooling and libraries, this could be the role for you.
As a team, we're responsible for designing, building, and operating the services we consume from AWS, along with the software we run on top like Kubernetes, Cassandra, Prometheus, and Kafka. We're also responsible for operating our two physical data centres, our network, and being on-call for the things we own and run.
To achieve this, we're organised into three squads within the Platform Group; Infrastructure Platform, Backend Platform and Stateful Platform. Each squad is responsible for solving a specific set of problems for our customers and our engineers. We're looking for engineers who are interested in joining any of these squads right now, but there are opportunities to move between them as you gain experience with our platform.
We've posted a good overview of our platform on our blog if you'd like to learn more.
We're investing a lot of up-front effort in building a scalable, secure, and extensible architecture for our millions of customers. Come and help us build a state-of-the-art microservices platform and build the kind of bank you want to use.
Our engineers have a variety of different backgrounds
We have several non-graduates; only some of us studied Computer Science; some of us have worked in huge companies; some have only ever worked in startups; others are former consultants. As long as you enjoy learning new things, we'd love to talk to you. We do not ask for formal qualifications or degree requirements for any of our engineering roles.
We are actively creating an equitable environment for all of our engineers to thrive
Diversity and inclusion are a priority for us and we are making sure we have lots of support for all of our people to grow at Monzo. We provide a sponsorship framework in Engineering for women and people of colour; all of our leaders are trained on privilege awareness and we are creating partnerships with organisations dedicated to supporting underrepresented groups. You can read more in our 2020 Diversity and Inclusion report.
Monzo works in project-based sprints in small, interdisciplinary teams
We have around 150 engineers out of roughly 1,400 people in total - and we have big ambitions. There are many interesting challenges ahead, and we're happy for people to move between teams or to specialise, whatever you prefer. As an engineer here you'd be able to work directly with anyone across the company, and we run regular knowledge-sharing sessions so you'll learn heaps about everything from how banks work to effective communication.
We encourage an open and transparent working environment
You can get involved in any aspect of the business you are interested in and, following Stripe's example, all emails in the company are visible in an email archive. We contribute to open source software as much as possible. We've also made our product roadmap public and give sneak peeks of features in our community forum. Our technology blog is a good place to learn even more about what we do!
At Monzo you will get to work with a lot of exciting new technology.
We rely heavily on the following tools and technologies:
Go to write our application code (we also use Go to write software to control and manage our platform)
AWS for most of our infrastructure
Kubernetes to schedule and run our services (Chris, our Technical Director of Platform and Reliability and Suhail, a Staff Engineer in our Platform Collective gave a great talk recently at re:Invent sharing an overview of our platform)
Prometheus to monitor everything! (see How we Monitor Monzo)
Envoy Proxy for our Service Mesh
Kafka for our asynchronous message queue
Cassandra for most persistent data storage
We also have three physical data centre sites with a number of leased lines to connect our cloud infrastructure to various payment systems
You should apply if:
Our open roles are for mid-level to senior candidates at present. Apply if:
the work we're doing sounds exciting!
you're a software engineer at heart and you're comfortable writing software to solve problems
you're interested in distributed systems and writing resilient, scalable software
you have strong experience working on the backend of a technology product
you're familiar with some of our Platform technologies, or specialise in just one part
you want to help build, scale and operate a platform to support a product that you (and everyone you know) use every day
you're keen to learn more about new technologies and the arcane inner workings of the financial industry
you're comfortable working in a team that deals with ambiguity
Logistics
Salary ranges between £70,000 - £116,000 plus stock options and other benefits.
We can help you relocate to London & we can sponsor visas.
This role can be based in our London office, but we're open to distributed working (as long as you can occasionally visit our London offices - usually a couple of days a month).
We're usually always hiring for engineers, so there's no closing date for this job.
We offer flexible working hours and trust you to work enough hours to do your job well, at times that suit you and your team.
Diversity and inclusion is a priority for us – if we want to solve problems for people around the world, our team has to represent our customers. So we need to attract the best talent and create an environment that supports and includes them. You can read more about diversity and inclusion on our blog.
If you prefer to work part-time, we'll make this happen whenever we can - whether this is to help you meet other commitments or strike a great work-life balance.
Our interview process is normally a phone interview, a coding task and call to discuss it, and 2-3 hours of onsite interviews that can be conducted via hangouts as well. We promise not to ask you any brain teasers or trick questions. We might design a system together on a whiteboard, the same way we often work together, but we won't make you write code on one.
Equal Opportunity Statement
At Monzo, embracing diversity in all of its forms and fostering an inclusive environment for all people to do the best work of their lives with us. This is integral to our mission of making money work for everyone.
We're an equal opportunity employer. All applicants will be considered for employment without attention to ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, family or parental status, national origin, veteran, neurodiversity status or disability status.

You'll help us with the following questions and challenges:
Securing our critical infrastructure, such as Kubernetes, Cassandra, Kafka, and the AWS services, Data Centres and networks they rely on;
Providing and managing the foundational infrastructure for other Security and Platform Engineering squads to build upon;
Managing our secrets, keys and certificates to ensure our systems are airtight;
Automating access control and permissioning for our cloud infrastructure.
Here are some of the projects the team have worked on in the past:
Controlling outbound traffic from Kubernetes
Building our secret management platform
Building network isolation for 1,500 services
The role
You'll be responsible for:
Ensuring that our cloud infrastructure and physical data centres are secure;
Building a deep understanding of the security of key technologies such as Vault, Kubernetes, Cassandra, Teleport and AWS and how we can improve them;
Performing threat modelling to mitigate the most important attack vectors against our infrastructure.
Monzo's security team has a wide range of responsibilities. As a bank, we are solving diverse, novel problems to ensure that our customers and their data are secure.
One of the guiding principles of security at Monzo is that security at the expense of user experience is a last resort. We aim to move mountains in the background so that we can build world-class features without compromising on security.
As a Backend Engineer in Security you'd be able to work directly with lots of teams across the company, and we run regular knowledge-sharing sessions so you'll learn heaps about everything; from how banks work to effective communication and the technologies we use.
You should apply if
You have experience in software engineering (we use Go, but we're open to all backgrounds) and you're excited about solving large-scale infrastructure security problems.
You're comfortable securing cloud-based environments and networks, and wrangling with code at this level of abstraction.
You're passionate about security and understand best practices.
You're constantly looking for flaws in systems and can reason about how best to address them.
Logistics
Salary ranges between £75,000 - £100,000 plus stock options and other benefits.
We can help you relocate to London & we can sponsor visas.
This role can be based in our London office, but we're open to distributed working.
We have payroll set up in four countries: the UK, Ireland, and France. Right now, we can only hire people who work from those countries and we'll keep this updated with new ones as we expand and are able to hire from more places
We offer flexible working hours and trust you to work enough hours to do your job well, at times that suit you and your team.
Diversity and inclusion is a priority for us – if we want to solve problems for people around the world, our team has to represent our customers. So we need to attract the best talent and create an environment that supports and includes them. You can read more about diversity and inclusion on our blog.
If you prefer to work part-time, we'll make this happen whenever we can - whether this is to help you meet other commitments or strike a great work-life balance.
Our interview process is normally an initial phone interview followed by a take-home task and call to discuss it (or alternatively a paired-programming exercise), if successful you will move to a final round of 3 separate interviews conducted via hangouts. We promise not to ask you any brain teasers or trick questions. We might design a system together on a whiteboard, the same way we often work together, but we won't make you write code on one.
Equal Opportunity Statement
At Monzo, embracing diversity in all of its forms and fostering an inclusive environment for all people to do the best work of their lives with us. This is integral to our mission of making money work for everyone.
We're an equal opportunity employer. All applicants will be considered for employment without attention to ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, family or parental status, national origin, veteran, neurodiversity status or disability status.
What is Monzo about?
We're a bank on a mission to make money work for everyone. By focusing on solving real problems rather than selling financial products, treating people fairly and being totally transparent, we believe we can make banking better.
Monzo started in 2015 with big plans and a little office in Shoreditch, London. Now we're a fully-licensed bank with millions of customers in the UK, and well over a thousand employees around the world.

The goal of Payments is to ensure that making and receiving a payment is a seamless, safe and delightful experience. We're at the heart of the bank and own some of the core infrastructure and services that make Monzo, Monzo… Hello Hot Coral Cards
Engineering squads within Payments carry out a mixture of project and operational work to generate revenue, automate manual processes, implement key controls and stay compliant with the various payment schemes we participate in.
Previous payments team projects have included building our very own Mastercard processor (from scratch), replacing a third-party Faster Payments Gateway with our own internal gateway, improving the international money transfer experience for our customers and supporting other teams within Monzo as they build innovative new features and services using our Payments infrastructure e.g. Monzo Flex, virtual cards & Monzo Pay. We've delivered industry leading Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) and 3D Secure V2 (3DSV2) implementations.

Github PRs require the automated test suite to pass (which you will likely have added to), and…","About us
Cronofy's mission is to Schedule Everything For Everyone. Over the past 7 years we’ve grown a self-sustaining, profitable business on our enterprise-ready Scheduling API.
We’re now building a direct-to-user offering in the form of our Scheduler so we can improve the scheduling workflows of even more people.
The role
We’ve done the hard work of synchronising with all the major calendar services and pushing that data into our Availability Engine. We’re now doing the really hard work of making that power accessible to everyone, not just developers, in a way that respects their privacy.
Building such a product requires a different set of skills to building an API, and so we’re looking to expand our team. The ideal person loves to work where the ones and zeroes turn into fonts and shapes, but I want to talk to anyone who isn’t allergic to writing Javascript.
We are looking for a Software Developer who can, or aspire to, shepherd features from idea through to real-world usage, the experience to make the hundred small decisions along the way that requires, and the humility to ask for feedback at the right times.
We strive to enable people to look for guidance when needed, not permission, and to give you the resources to be self-sufficient and fulfill your potential. As a team we aim to work together to produce ideas and products greater than those we could alone.
About you
Practices such as pairing are neither mandated nor discouraged. We trust you to know how you work best, we only ask that you keep the team informed of your progress and ask for help when needed.
We're strong on compliance but this doesn't mean you have to deal with an arduous development process. Github PRs require the automated test suite to pass (which you will likely have added to), and approval by a peer, before they can be merged. From there, the build and deployment process is automated.
This all generates the audit trail necessary to show we follow our change management process.
Like all of our processes, they are lightweight, fit-for-purpose, and open to change when we find them lacking.
We pride ourselves on happy customers, so part of your responsibilities are fixing bugs, sharing the technical support, and improving our documentation to reduce the amount of direct support we need to provide.
Your capabilities
Our stack:
Terraform, AWS, Postgres, Redis, Kubernetes, Ruby on Rails, React, SASS form the core of our stack.
We also have Go in our toolset for situations where performance is paramount.
Familiarity with any of these is a benefit, none of them are essential as you’ll be smart enough to learn what’s necessary with our help.
How we work
Remote-first as an engineering team before the pandemic, we’re currently fully remote. We're starting to, carefully, resume meetings in person as the value of real-world interaction is high. Our team currently covers the Midlands, South of England, and Spain.
Meetups will happen in London where we have an office in a shared space, or Nottingham where our dedicated company HQ is.
As a team we have a daily sit-down, and weekly planning/review meetings. As a company we have a weekly all-hands call to share our work, successes, and challenges. We use our principles to guide our behaviour.
Team meetups are likely to be monthly once they can happen again, all travel and accommodation necessary are covered by the company through your own prepaid card.
In 2019 we held a company retreat, that was not possible in 2020 but it is something we would like to do at least annually.
Hiring process
The goal is to discover what you will bring to Cronofy and what Cronofy will bring to you. It's as important for you to determine whether this is the right move for your career as much as anything else, so don't be afraid to ask questions.
Initial call
During a 30 minute video call with our CTO, Garry, you’ll get to know each other a little. We’ll look to find out what you’re looking for in your next role as part of your career progression, your approach to growing software in a holistic sense, and the kind of support you need to do your best work.
You’ll have chance to ask any questions you may have about the role, the team, or the company. Please feel free to ask absolutely anything, in the worst case we won’t be able to answer specifically due to confidentiality or similar, but we’ll at least be able to give a holistic answer.
Coding exercise and discussion
All being well, we’ll ask you to do a coding exercise which shouldn’t take more than 60 minutes. It’s not about building a complete product, as much as a conversation starter for a second 30 minute call together where we’ll get a bit more technical.
Meet the team
From there, you’ll be invited to talk to other people from the team, similarly video calls of 15-30 minutes. These are as much for you to get a feel for the team, as for the team to provide feedback about you. I’d like you to speak to at least two people, but you can speak to as many as you need to feel comfortable that it’s a team you want to join. Like all stages this is a two-way conversation so you are free to interview them too.
Final stage
Usually at this point we would spend a morning or afternoon together, in current circumstances that’s not possible. Instead, we’d look to schedule a call split into three main sections, with breaks in between, along with Adam, our CEO and co-founder. Those sections are:
Work history - this helps us better understand your professional background
A “whiteboard discussion” - this gives us another example of how well you communicate - in-person this was you describing how a system you were familiar with worked, in a remote environment that might be a prepared presentation or image(s) shared before the call, whatever you are comfortable with
Culture fit - this helps us understand what you would bring to Cronofy and what Cronofy would bring to you, and see if those are aligned to each of our desires
For successful candidates, we will extend an offer conditional on reference and background checks.
At some point throughout this process, if possible, we'd like to meet you in a suitably physically-distanced manner to make at least part of this process 3D.
What we offer
£45,000 - £60,000 dependant on experience
Pension scheme
25 days holiday in addition to national holidays. National holidays are added to your holiday allowance and you're not required to take them on the corresponding day.
Training and personal development days.
A principles driven culture.
Supportive colleagues who enjoy spending time together.

These are Grade 6 Research IT Software Engineer/Data Science posts on a permanent-subject-to-funding basis.
The University of Manchester has a long and distinguished tradition of academic excellence, and an ambitious agenda for the future. We have close links to industry, the public sector and the local community, and we are firmly committed to furthering knowledge, enabling achievement and encouraging social responsibility both amongst our cosmopolitan community of staff and students, and in the wider world. The University has a world-class research profile, outstanding facilities and support services, and has an institutional goal of being among the world's top 25 universities in terms of its research.
Research IT provides research-focussed, specialist computing infrastructure, software engineering, data science, application support and training to researchers across a wide range of domains, who have diverse technical requirements. Our scope includes the support of disciplines that may not traditionally be regarded as IT-intensive; for example the increasing importance of digital technologies within various lines of Humanities research. Our support ranges from advice on available applications packages, and handling simple enquiries for those getting started, through to more in-depth bug fixing, coding and software development which may require days, weeks or months of effort.
As a member of the Research IT team, you will be responsible for providing software engineering expertise to researchers, research projects and our own platforms while working on engagements from a few weeks to many months in duration. You will work on research projects from conception to completion, gathering requirements, helping with grant applications, implementing, and documenting as required. The initial assignment for this post will be to work on the NERC funded Digital Solutions Programme.
NERC’s Digital Solutions programme was created to develop innovative digital services that deliver economic, societal, and environmental benefits across the UK. It has been designed to move beyond just academic use and exploitation of existing data holdings. Our ethos is to build a Digital Solutions Hub as a gateway to a broad set of inter-connected toolkits that facilitate improved access and better use of NERC data. These may already exist, or will be created with our partners, which include the NHS, Defra, PHE and HSE, as well as local and regional SMEs and individual members of society. Providing easier access to NERC's environmental data offers opportunities for improving peoples' health and better understanding the impacts of climate change on people, land, and property across the UK. Indeed, initially we will focus on two areas 'Connected Healthy Nation' and 'A Climate Ready Nation' as use cases. It is expected, as the programme develops, more use cases will come online.
We are interested in receiving applications from people who have extensive experience in the complete software engineering lifecycle and who have a passion for supporting researchers. We are particularly keen to hear from people who have experience in one or more of Data Science, Geospatial Analysis, Data Visualisation, User Experience and Sustainable and Reproducible Research. The ideal candidate will be able to demonstrate proficiency with one or more programming languages such as, but not limited to, Python, R, C, C++, C#, Java, Fortran and Shell.
In your application please ensure you make clear reference to the domains, languages and technologies you have experience of. Research IT will provide training in other areas as part of your career progression.
We are looking for enthusiastic team members who are able to learn new skills, can communicate effectively with researchers and colleagues (whatever their IT ability), and are keen to work on a diverse range of problems ranging from giving immediate answers to working for or alongside researchers on projects that may last from days to months.
As an equal opportunities employer we welcome applicants from all sections of the community regardless of age, sex, gender (or gender identity), ethnicity, disability, sexual orientation and transgender status. All appointments are made on merit.
Our University is positive about flexible working – you can find out more here

And when it comes to getting paid, people want their cash yesterday. But every year organizations waste time, money and energy sending more than $20 trillion in payouts to individuals using cash, checks, credit, debit, prepaid and gift cards! Held back by the legacy banking systems, crushed by the costs and complexity of credit cards there is this monster industry still lingering in the digital dark ages.
At WeGift we’re changing all that. We’ve built our own proprietary payment rails that enables any organisation to send money to any individual, anywhere, instantly. No bank account required. No insane interchange fees. We even get up to 20% in commissions from retailers for driving sales which we pass onto our customers. It’s discounted money! We’re throwing away the old model, and transforming how we move and use money forever.
We want amazing people like you to join us and be part of that journey.

Requirements
Our Team
We’re building a Product & Engineering team where people can do their best work that sits right at the heart of the business. We want to hire talented engineers who see WeGift as an opportunity to grow and to make an impact.
We have Python and TypeScript services running across Kubernetes (EKS) and Lambda functions. Our persistence is largely Aurora (Postgres), DynamoDB and their event triggers.
We have structures in place from hiring and levelling to how we make technical decisions that will allow the right people to thrive and we want world class engineers to be a part of that journey. We welcome applications from engineers from any programming language that are enthusiastic about cross-training to Python and Typescript.
The Role
As a Senior Software Engineer, you will be responsible for architecting, implementing and deploying software services from end to end. You’ll produce clean, scalable, and reusable code to build products which will have a big impact on our customers.
You will have the opportunity to work with a modern stack and serverless cloud infrastructure whilst guiding and mentoring more junior engineers in the team.
*
What Excites You*
Contributing towards the design, delivery and deployment of large scale, complex projects which are used heavily by thousands of people with high throughput.
Using modern technology like AWS serverless infrastructure and events driven microservice architecture
Mentoring more junior members of the team to help support their growth and development and to ensure the team is levelling up.
Being a subject matter expert on technology and domain-specific problems, and taking ownership of software services from end to end.
Improving responsiveness and overall performance of our web services.
Helping to scale the team by leading on technical interviews.
What Excites Us
Around 5+ years of Software Engineering experience architecting and developing new services and features from end to end.
The ability to take ownership of design and architecture of large scale systems and developing API heavy software solutions without the need for guidance.
A passion for promoting software engineering best practice, guiding and mentoring more junior engineers to deliver clean, scalable, and reusable code.
Proactively contributing to the continual improvement of our engineering processes
Some of the project you could be working on:
Integration into all physical stores and merchants with POS. Consumers can spend their value where they want to as we go beyond Gift Cards.
Continued development of our infrastructure. Transitioning to serverless infrastructure and microservices to enable us to scale rapidly as a team
Building a brand new internal tool chain. So non technical teams can on-board new payment partners
Building our wallet feature. Consumers can aggregate the value they accumulate and spend that digital value when and where they choose to.
Technical resilience. As we become more integral to our customers’ businesses, how can we make sure that we can continue to serve them even when there are technical or logistics issues upstream.
Recent examples of new features:
WeGift Select. This allows us to give the customer choice, and therefore go beyond simply reselling gift cards and towards our strategic vision of helping value to flow more freely in the global economy. This project was technically challenging due to a requirement for it to work across a wide selection of devices.
Self-serve brand on-boarding. WeGift is growing rapidly, which means we have to challenge ourselves to use technology to give a great experience to our brand partners without them needing a lot of support from the customer success team.
Ongoing integration with gift card processors. Right at the heart of WeGift’s operations, this technology needs to scale seamlessly and maintain high standards of reliability, maintainability and security. We’re also constantly asking ourselves how we can make this process more efficient - how can we make a capital investment now to reduce operational spend in the future, and that in turn requires a creative take on the underlying technology.

About Us...
Permutive is powering the future of targeted advertising on the Open Web today. As the only Audience Platform built on edge computing, we enable premium advertisers and publishers to plan, build and activate cohorts — all while keeping everyone's data safe.
We're a remote-first B2B SaaS company with 140+ people—centred around our London and New York hubs—and growing rapidly. We have received funding from some of the world's best investors, including a recent $75m Series C led by SoftBank Vision Fund 2.
About the Role...
Permutive is expanding our engineering team further and we are looking for a Scala Engineer to join our Dashboard team and help enable our customers and internal teams to engage with Permutive's fundamental products in a coherent and consistent manner.
You'll use a wide range of technologies to build the functionality that solves previously-impossible problems for our customers and helps them deliver value through our platform. You should be keen to own the process of building new product features and managing the whole development process, including coding, testing, deploying, and monitoring.
The wider context
Permutive is a B2B SaaS company building the data platform and tools for a world with a trillion edge devices. We have product–market fit and customers that love us, and we're 130+ people and growing rapidly in Europe and the US. We have received funding from some of the world's best investors, including Y Combinator.
We're 40+ engineers working to build an outstanding engineering culture so that everyone who joins has the opportunity and the support to do the best work of their life. Small, autonomous teams are important to us, and we want to empower everyone to make—and be accountable for—decisions through ownership.
Everything we build has to scale: our platform handles more requests each day than there are new tweets and Google searches, and each month we see more than a billion users. We think applying functional programming techniques like compositionality and type-safety is the best way to build the type of massive distributed system our platform comprises, allowing us to move fast without sacrificing quality.
Teams and technologies
The Dashboard team are focussed on enabling our customers and internal teams to engage with Permutive's fundamental products in a coherent and consistent manner. We are responsible for the Dashboard, which all of our customers use to interact with our underlying platform and technology. The team owns some of the fundamental concepts that enable these interactions, such as organizations and workspaces, or identity and access management. We collaborate closely with other product engineering teams to expose new features in our Dashboard.
We would love to hear from Software Engineers that have knowledge or an interest in working with some of the technologies we use:
Scala: cats, cats-effect, http4s, circe, doobie, refined
Infrastructure: Kubernetes, Kafka, Postgres, Grafana, Terraform
You will be responsible for helping the team build backend systems that power our Dashboard, finding better ways to interact with systems owned by other teams and building new features that affect the way customers login and engage with the Dashboard.
The ideal candidate will have
Experience working with REST APIs in Scala
Experience collaborating closely with frontend engineers or teams
Able to communicate technical concepts clearly
Have a broad understanding of software engineering concepts
Excellent verbal and written communication skills
We'd be particularly excited if you have one or more of the below
Experience working with Identity & Access Management systems
Interest in Dashboard security practices such as SSO, 2FA
Experience pulling data from various systems and surfacing it in a UI
Experience with messaging systems (e.g. Kafka or Kinesis) and distributed data stores (e.g. Cassandra, Bigtable, DynamoDB)
Experience building and deploying microservices, e.g. using Kubernetes
Experience with cloud platforms such as AWS or GCP
Familiarity with functional Scala libraries, e.g. Cats or Doobie
Salary
We take a structured, objective approach to salary-setting, which is based on market information, our compensation strategy, and your experience and capability as assessed through our interview process.
For a typical candidate with strong Scala experience plus most of our requirements we would likely pay £80,000 + options.
For a candidate with a breadth of experience, and who meets several of our bonus criteria, we'd pay up to £100,000 + options.
Benefits...
Stock options
Parental Leave Policy entitling new parents up to 26 weeks of leave on full pay

Time to rest and relax with unlimited paid leave (minimum expectation of 25 days annually)
Extensive training and development opportunities
