The role will evolve quickly as you become more experienced and knowledgeable through the university course. The following will always remain at the core of the role:
Investigate new technologies and their suitability to us.
Create technical specifications which can be understood by non-technical people.
Develop existing systems by analysing and identifying areas for modification
Write and test code, refining and rewriting, rollout and storing.
Maintain systems by monitoring and correcting software defects.
Continually update your technical knowledge and skills.
You will be working in an office environment and so good communication skills are key as you will collaborate frequently with many members of staff.
A typical day
9 am – 11 am: Review the performance of a part of the IT infrastructure, tweak existing code based on feedback from users and error logs.
11 am – 12 pm: Have a meeting with a senior member of staff to discuss the roadblocks you are facing with the development of the next software rollout.

Graduate Software Engineer
Now more than ever, people want every experience to be instant and on-demand. And when it comes to getting paid, people want their cash yesterday. But every year organizations waste time, money and energy sending more than $20 trillion in payouts to individuals using cash, checks, credit, debit, prepaid and gift cards! Held back by the legacy banking systems, crushed by the costs and complexity of credit cards there is this monster industry still lingering in the digital dark ages.
At WeGift we’re changing all that. We’ve built our own proprietary payment rails that enables any organisation to send money to any individual, anywhere, instantly. No bank account required. No insane interchange fees. We even get up to 20% in commissions from retailers for driving sales which we pass onto our customers. It’s discounted money! We’re throwing away the old model, and transforming how we move and use money forever.
We want amazing people like you to join us and be part of that journey.

Requirements*
We’re building a Product & Engineering team where people can do their best work that sits right at the heart of the business. We want to hire talented engineers who see WeGift as an opportunity to grow and to make an impact.
We have Python and TypeScript services running across Kubernetes (EKS) and Lambda functions. Our persistence is largely Aurora (Postgres), DynamoDB and their event triggers.
We have structures in place from hiring and levelling to how we make technical decisions that will allow the right people to thrive and we want world class engineers to be a part of that journey. We welcome applications from engineers from any programming language that are enthusiastic about cross-training to Python and Typescript.
The Role
As a Graduate Software Engineer, you will be responsible for supporting our software engineering team in all aspects of the development, testing, and implementation of our products.
*
What Excites You*
The opportunity to work within a super talented engineering team, writing, maintaining and testing code in line with our engineering standards.
Contributing to software design for features and bug fixes.
Using experience gained from your education or internship to add value to technical and team meetings, working with our senior software engineers to solve complex problems.
Helping to scale the team by shadowing on technical interviews.
What Excites Us
Computer science or Software Engineering degree or equivalent industry background
Enthusiasm to learn and apply the skills you have gained throughout your education or internship to support on architecture and development of scalable systems and API heavy software solutions.
Experience with server side technologies like Python, Java, C#, Ruby, GoLang, JavaScript or any other backend language.
Outstanding communication and willingness to master your craft
Some of the project you could be working on:
Integration into all physical stores and merchants with POS. Consumers can spend their value where they want to as we go beyond Gift Cards.
Continued development of our infrastructure. Transitioning to serverless infrastructure and microservices to enable us to scale rapidly as a team
Building a brand new internal tool chain so non technical teams can on-board new payment partners
Building our wallet feature. Consumers can aggregate the value they accumulate and spend that digital value when and where they choose to.
Technical resilience. As we become more integral to our customers’ businesses, how can we make sure that we can continue to serve them even when there are technical or logistics issues upstream.
Recent examples of new features:
WeGift Select. This allows us to give the customer choice, and therefore go beyond simply reselling gift cards and towards our strategic vision of helping value to flow more freely in the global economy. This project was technically challenging due to a requirement for it to work across a wide selection of devices.
Self-serve brand on-boarding. WeGift is growing rapidly, which means we have to challenge ourselves to use technology to give a great experience to our brand partners without them needing a lot of support from the customer success team.
Ongoing integration with gift card processors. Right at the heart of WeGift’s operations, this technology needs to scale seamlessly and maintain high standards of reliability, maintainability and security. We’re also constantly asking ourselves how we can make this process more efficient - how can we make a capital investment now to reduce operational spend in the future, and that in turn requires a creative take on the underlying technology.

Handling over 600 billion queries per day (more than 100X the query volume of search globally), our platform operates at unprecedented scale. We have also built something even stronger and more valuable: an award-winning culture based on trust, empathy, collaboration, and ownership. By working together across typical dividing lines, we are better as a team than any of us could be apart.
Do you have a passion for solving hard problems at scale? Are you eager to join a trust-based, globally-connected team, where your contributions will make a meaningful difference?
Come and see why Fortune Magazine consistently ranks The Trade Desk among best small-medium sized workplaces globally.
About the Role:
Our Software Engineers are end-to-end owners. You will participate actively in all aspects of designing, building , and delivering products for our clients.
We have dozens of individual, mission-focused teams working across a wide spectrum of technological challenges. You will have the opportunity, depending on your interests and aptitude, to work on large-scale distributed systems coordinating thousands of servers in cloud and physical data centers around the world, petabyte-scale data challenges, machine learning , advanced visualizations, and interactive user interfaces – to name a few.
Software Engineers contribute to more than our product – they build up our team. Through a combination of mentoring, technical leadership, and/or direct management of small teams, they make others better and raise the bar for those around them.
Who We Are Looking For:
You understand engineering fundamentals. At our scale, many off-the-shelf techniques and existing technologies (open source and enterprise) simply don't work. You are able to work from first principles to evaluate solutions and adapt them to a unique environment.
You are a broadly skilled engineer , interested in developing web services and building always-on systems, working across a variety of technologies and service layers.
You have a product-focused mindset. You have the passion and ability to contribute to the process of discovering what will delight our clients and push forward one of the world’s largest and most influential industries toward a vision of openness, transparency, and evidence-based decision-making.
You work with confidence and without ego. You have strongly-held, defensible ideas, and advocate for what you believe is right. You are also adept at identifying and evaluating trade-offs, willing to be proven wrong, and quick to walk through fire to support your fellow teammates.
You value, seek out, and foster diversity. We are a global team from many diverse backgrounds, with different experiences and perspectives. To complement this team, you will welcome ideas that are different from your own and be skilled at finding and building from common ground.
You are a creative thinker, not bound by ""the way things have always been done"". What you know is less important than how well you learn and innovate. We don't need engineers who know all the answers; we need engineers who can invent the answers no one has thought of yet, to the questions yet to be asked.

Over the course of 10-12 weeks, you’ll be matched with full-time employees in your role who will mentor you as you tackle real-world projects they design. You’ll also be able to access our physical and virtual educational resources, attend guest speakers and social events, and hopefully get a real sense of what it would be like to work here full time.
If you’ve never thought about a career in finance, you’re in good company—many of us were in the same position before working here. If you have a curious mind, a collaborative nature, and a passion for solving interesting problems, we have a feeling you’ll fit right in.
About the Position
As a Software Engineering intern, you’ll learn how we use OCaml (our primary development language) in our day to day work, and gain exposure to the libraries and tools that are foundational to our internal systems.
During the programme you’ll work on two projects, mentored closely by the full-time employees who designed them. Some projects consider big-picture questions that we’re still trying to figure out, while others involve building something new. Your mentors will work in two distinct areas, so you’ll gain a better understanding of the wide range of problems we solve every day, from machine learning to systems administration to programming language design.
If you’d like to learn more, you can read about our interview process, meet some of our newest hires, or get a sense of what our most recent intern projects looked like.
About You
We don’t expect you to have a background in finance, OCaml, functional programming, or any other specific field—we’re looking for smart people who enjoy solving interesting problems. We’re more interested in how you think and learn than what you currently know. You should be:
A top-notch programmer with a passion for technology
Collaborative and courteous with strong interpersonal and communication skills
Eager to ask questions, admit mistakes, and learn new things

Kafka for our asynchronous message queue.
React for internal web dashboards.","At Monzo we're aiming to build the best current account in the world. We are always keen to hear from capable, creative engineers who want to help us accomplish that goal
Our backend engineers have a variety of different backgrounds
We have several non-graduates; only some of us studied Computer Science; one of the team has a degree in Marketing; some of us have worked in huge companies; some have only ever worked in startups; others are former consultants. As long as you enjoy learning new things, we'd love to talk to you. We do not ask for formal qualifications or degree requirements for any of our engineering roles.
We are actively creating an equitable environment for all of our engineers to thrive
Diversity and inclusion are a priority for us and we are making sure we have lots of support for all of our people to grow at Monzo. We provide a sponsorship framework in Engineering for women and people of colour; all of our leaders are trained on privilege awareness and we are creating partnerships with organisations dedicated to supporting underrepresented groups. You can read more in our 2020 Diversity and Inclusion report.
We encourage an open and transparent working environment
You can get involved in any aspect of the business you are interested in and, following Stripe's example, all emails in the company are visible in an email archive. We contribute to open source software as much as possible. Our blog is a good place to learn even more about what we do!
Monzo works in project-based sprints in small, interdisciplinary teams
We have around 150 engineers out of roughly 1,400 people in total - and we have big ambitions. There are many interesting challenges ahead, and we're happy for people to move between teams or to specialise, whatever you prefer. As an engineer here you'd be able to work directly with anyone across the company, and we run regular knowledge-sharing sessions so you'll learn heaps about everything from how banks work to effective communication.
At Monzo you will get to work with a lot of exciting new technology.
We rely heavily on the following tools and technologies:
Go to write our application code (there's an excellent interactive Go tutorial here)
Cassandra for most persistent data storage
Kafka for our asynchronous message queue
Envoy Proxy for RPC
Kubernetes and Docker to schedule and run our services (Oliver, our VP Architecture, gave a great talk at KubeCon on how we use these technologies)
AWS for most of our infrastructure
React for internal web dashboards
We also have two physical datacenter sites with actual cables to connect to various third parties
Our product squads are truly cross-functional.
This role is all about collaborating across disciplines to test hypotheses and make a difference to customers. As a product backend engineer you'll work in a squad alongside product managers, marketers, user researchers, designers, mobile engineers, web engineers, data analysts, business analysts, writers and more!
Together you'll build and support a particular part of Monzo. Our product squads belong to one of four collectives (a word we use to describe self-governing business units of ~100 people). They are: Growth & Core, Borrowing, Operations and Money. They're all looking for additional Backend Engineers right now.
The Growth & Core collective helps people to discover Monzo and make the most of it.
Growth & Core is a collective focused on different aspects of our mission to 'make money work for everyone' and it has four squads. They make users effortlessly financially savvy with features like Budgeting, Pots and the Salary Sorter. Many of the customer problems they solve are revenue opportunities, too – like Monzo Plus, Business Banking, and the Savings marketplace. Last year they also launched our Open Banking APIs, shipped a simpler and more future-proof navigation structure, and enabled Monzo customers to get their salary paid a day early for free!
The Borrowing collective makes borrowing money simple, fair and transparent.
We're really proud that this fair approach to lending helps people to get what they want from life on their own terms. Squads in Borrowing have already shipped and scaled overdrafts to hundreds of thousands of Monzo customers. They've made it easy to take out a loan without the unfair fees or confusing pricing that you find elsewhere. They work on everything from the way borrowing works in the app, right down to how they move and account for money that our customers borrow. One of the most interesting problems they face is deciding how much to lend and to whom. The team believes that they can make access to credit fairer and more transparent.
The Operations collective is responsible for our incredible customer support.
The Operations collective looks after one of the most interesting problem spaces at Monzo: as we grow, we want to ensure that we're using technology as effectively as possible whilst still maintaining customer service so good that you want to tell your friends. Our engineers within this area of the business help us to explore these challenges. Central to it all is Monzo Chat – a completely bespoke bit of software we've built from the ground up to manage chats in our app - but we're also doing work with machine learning, and looking at how technology can more broadly support our wonderful support team (we call them COps) in other aspects.
The Money collective helps Monzo move fast and in control with our money
We are the bank within the bank and are responsible for the core infrastructure and banking services you associate with Monzo. We are the Guardians of the Monzo Ledger and own everything related to our distinctive Hot Coral cards.
Engineering squads within the Money collective carry out a variety of payments and finance related work, we built our very own Mastercard processor from scratch and recently we successfully replaced a third-party Faster Payments Gateway with our own internal Gateway to reduce outages we can't control. On top of this we've been ensuring our payment schemes are compliant with key regulatory requirements such as Strong Customer Authentication (SCA), 3D Secure V2 (3DSV2), making sure that our core infrastructure and services will scale to support our ambitious growth plans and that we always know where our money is and can report accurately and reliably on it.
The financial crime at Monzo team focuses on making sure our services are a hostile environment for criminals
We tackle all financial crime together as one team, this includes money laundering, fraud, sanctions breaches, terrorist financing, bribery and corruption and tax evasion. Engineers get to work on core services that are consumed by many different products which means we have a really broad perspective. We've had some major successes in combating financial crime, most famously The Ticketmaster Breach where we spotted large-scale fraudulent activity due to a Ticketmaster data breach before Ticketmaster or other banks did.
The TechOps team
The TechOps team are challenging the traditional IT model by building a brand new people platform to automate all aspects of a Monzo staff member's time here. We're building an industry leading people platform to support our staff in a delightful way and to accommodate rapid growth across multiple countries. This approach will allow us to empower our staff by providing smart, efficient and powerful tools instead of relying on traditional IT systems and a horde of IT staff.
You should apply if
Our open roles are for mid-level to senior Backend Engineers at present.

you have strong experience working on the backend of a technology product
you think you'd enjoy the kind of work we're doing
you want to be involved in building a product that you (and the people you know) use every day
you have a product mindset: you care about customer outcomes and you want to make data-informed decisions
you're comfortable working in a team that deals with ambiguity
you're interested in distributed systems and writing resilient software
you have some experience with strongly-typed languages (Go, Java, C, Scala etc.).
Logistics
Salary is around £90,000 - £116,000 plus stock options and other benefits.
We can help you relocate to London & we can sponsor visas.
This role can be based in our London office, but we're open to distributed working (with ad hoc meetings in London once COVID is over).
We're usually always hiring for Backend Engineers, so there's no closing date for this job.
We offer flexible working hours and trust you to work enough hours to do your job well, at times that suit you and your team.
Diversity and inclusion is a priority for us – if we want to solve problems for people around the world, our team has to represent our customers. So we need to attract the best talent and create an environment that supports and includes them. You can read more about diversity and inclusion on our blog.
If you prefer to work part-time, we'll make this happen whenever we can - whether this is to help you meet other commitments or strike a great work-life balance.
Our interview process is normally a phone interview, a coding task and call to discuss it, and 2-3 hours of onsite interviews that can be conducted via hangouts as well. We promise not to ask you any brain teasers or trick questions. We might design a system together on a whiteboard, the same way we often work together, but we won't make you write code on one.
Equal Opportunity Statement
At Monzo, embracing diversity in all of its forms and fostering an inclusive environment for all people to do the best work of their lives with us. This is integral to our mission of making money work for everyone.
We're an equal opportunity employer. All applicants will be considered for employment without attention to ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, family or parental status, national origin, veteran, neurodiversity status or disability status.

(Holiday note: We usually respond within 24 hours but are taking a break at the end of December 2021. Expect a response in early January.)
Lindus Health is looking for a software engineer (full-stack engineer, backend engineer or frontend engineer) to build the platform powering the next generation of clinical trials. Join a small team in the early stages of product development and grow your skills as we scale the product to manage complex trials and bring new treatments to patients faster!
About us
Clinical trials are in crisis. The industry hasn't changed in 30 years, and the cost of bringing new medicines to market is skyrocketing as a result.
Lindus Health’s mission is to fix this. We accelerate clinical trials, so patients can benefit. We’re building the world’s first full stack clinical trial platform, to conduct faster, safer clinical trials on behalf of companies developing new treatments, and lowering the barriers to participation for patients.
Since launching the company in March 2021 we have helped find over 5,000 patients for more than 25 clinical trials in areas like type 2 diabetes, COVID-19 diagnostics and mental health. We closed a $5m seed round to grow our platform and team.

About you
Our wish list for this role looks something like this:
You have 2 years or more experience as a software engineer collaborating in a team
You’re a full-stack engineer, or you specialize in backend or frontend development - at this point we have a need for both generalists and specialists. Backend: You have some experience with Python/Django or similar frameworks (e.g., Flask, Ruby on Rails, Node/Express). Frontend: You have some experience with a modern client framework (e.g., React, Vue, Ember).
You are product-minded: you want to understand why we are building something to figure out the best how in collaboration with product managers, UX designers and users.
You want to be a part of building a new team and new products from scratch. You like an early-stage startup environment where you have autonomy and opportunities to grow in all areas that interest you.
You belong here! If your experience and interests match with some of the above, we want you to apply.

What will you do?
In your first month:
Learn about clinical trials and the problems we are trying to solve from our co-founders, medical lead and trial managers
Collaborate with the product team on a starter project, make your first commits and your first deploys
Become familiar with the core components of our stack (React, TypeScript, Django, Python, Postgres, Amazon ECS)
In your first 3 months:
Become a part of the regular product development cycle where you work for example on features to collect data from trial participants and to help trial staff keep track of progress
Observe the product being used in real trials and support the team in responding to feature requests and bug reports
Within your first year:
Take on responsibility for substantial new features and facilitate related architecture and design decisions
Shape our engineering practices and work on making the team more productive in areas such as testing, CI, deployment pipelines, cloud architecture
Help grow the product & engineering team by interviewing candidates, onboarding new hires and possibly mentoring junior engineers
What we offer
Base salary based on experience in the range £55K to £80K, plus 0.1% - 0.3% stock options
Unlimited holidays; everyone is encouraged to take off at least 28 days each year
Flexible office arrangement; come into the office in London (near Victoria station) as often as you like, or work remotely (within the UK)
Monthly team events and days out (pandemic permitting); recently we've been to Legoland, and a Millwall FC home game (decided by popular vote)
If working mostly remotely: regular all-expenses paid trips to London to see the whole team (pandemic permitting)
Up to £500 towards setting up your home office
A new laptop as your main workstation
UK visa sponsorship if you’re not already eligible to work in the UK
Our technology strategy
Collaboration rocks. We like processes that emphasize openness and knowledge sharing across disciplines, across hierarchies and across time. We acknowledge that sharing, discussing and documenting their work means a certain amount of overhead for individuals, but this is more than offset in the long run by a culture of healthy teams and individual growth.
Iterate with abandon. We recognize that we often don’t know what the heck we’re doing when we start working on a new feature or technical problem, but we know that our understanding will improve as we start down a path to a particular solution. We favor tools and processes that support rapid iteration and frequent validation through user feedback and metrics.
Favor boring technology. We choose languages, frameworks, libraries, architectures and tools that are well-established in order to focus on the part that's hard and exciting and accelerates clinical trials the most: product development. We like a mature technology that has been around for at least a decade with abundant documentation and a large community around it. We deviate from this norm in targeted areas of innovation relevant to the business.
Related reading: Boring Technology (Dan McKinley), Buy vs build (Camille Fournier)
Test in production. We recognize that the last steps of integration and productionization of a new feature are hard - often harder than writing the code in the first place. We favor tools and processes that let us deploy to production early and often and as confidently as possible. We believe that deep insight into how their code behaves with real data and real users is crucial for engineers to get better at their craft.

Our current stack: React, TypeScript, Django, Python, Postgres, Amazon ECS
Our hiring process for engineers
Send your resume to jobs@lindushealth.com. We welcome all applicants regardless of gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, religion, civil or family status, age, disability, or race. If Lindus Health’s mission resonates with you, we want you to apply! We commit to responding to you within 24 hours (weekends and holidays excepted).
Initial call with a co-founder (30 minutes): This is your opportunity to learn more about Lindus Health. We want to tell you about our mission and what we're doing to revolutionise health research.
Technical discussion with Nik, our CTO and a co-founder (90 minutes): This is a session in two parts where we figure out whether your technical skills mesh with our team. We deliberately don’t demand you write code or solve algorithm puzzles in real time, though you have the option to do a coding challenge at your own pace if you like.
Part 1: Code. You can choose between talking about a piece of code you’ve already written or complete a coding challenge at home that we then talk about. In the first option, you share a piece of your code that you think is interesting. We will walk through the code together and discuss your thought process, challenges you’ve faced and potential refactorings. If you choose the second option you get instructions for a coding challenge that you can do at your own pace ahead of the discussion. The challenge is designed to take no more than 2 hours to complete.
Part 2: Architecture & practices. We will share a document with you in advance that explains our team’s current architecture choices and practices. We will discuss what appeals to you about it, what you would change and what you would add to it. As an early team member you will have a real say in evolving this.
Values interview (45 minutes): This is a conversation with 1 or 2 co-founders about our values and culture and also your chance to ask any questions you still have about Lindus Health.
Meeting the team (one or two calls of 30 mins, or an in-person meeting if you’re in London): At this stage you’ll want to get to know more of the people you’ll be working with. We’ll set up informal calls or meet you in person at our office near Victoria station in London.
Offer! If you've come this far, receive an offer and join the team to help us bring about the next generation of healthcare research. We move fast and usually make a decision within hours of your last meeting."

Our applied scientists seek to balance cutting-edge research with pragmatism and creativity when designing new models. We touch on a range of interesting topics such as probabilistic programming and reinforcement learning to name just two.

Area of impact
You will work broadly; conceptualising a system and writing a design document, building software to convert that into a prototype model (we are language agnostic, and usually work in Python and C++) and you will help educate others on your approach.
Your role will combine literature reviews, conceptual modelling & software engineering to create scientifically defensible models that underpin our product offering
Building software pipelines to extract and integrate data from various sources, making it available to simulation engines and user interfaces.

You support and have a clear appreciation of the modern software engineering workflow & delivery mechanisms.
You are enthusiastic about continuously improving and rapidly developing new competencies.
You are able to effectively communicate with clients in person, in writing and with visualisation.
You have an interest in machine learning engineering (e.g. agent-based modelling, discrete-event simulation, system dynamics, bayesian networks, probabilistic programming, machine learning).

While we think the above experience could be important, we’re keen to hear from people that believe they have valuable experience to bring to the role. If you identify with the team and mission, but not all of our requirements, then please still apply.

Software Engineer - Data Services,Deliveroo,https://uk.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=5bd91f33583d8a3e&fccid=1d79a4290fb70d8e&vjs=3,3.3,London,,"We need skilled software engineers who enjoy solving infrastructure and data problems with code.
People in our team use software and systems engineering skills…","Why Deliveroo?
When you first think about Deliveroo, you probably think of getting great food to your house in less than half an hour. Awesome right? But behind the scenes is the real story. This story is one of high growth, huge challenges and an enormous opportunity ahead of us. It began with our founder Will, arriving in London over 7 years ago and finding it almost impossible to order great food, despite the wealth of incredible restaurants in the city. Fast forward 6 years and we operate in 13 countries with over 70,000 riders who deliver orders from 80,000 restaurants in over 500 cities worldwide.
We want to be the definitive food company - the app you go to any time you have a hunger pang. We are already transforming the way people think about food, providing people with limitless access to different cuisines and restaurants, turning cooking from a chore to a choice, and giving people the freedom to eat what they want, when they want, where they want it.
We work with riders, restaurants and consumers. We operate one of the most complex three-sided marketplaces in the world and we do this in real time. Millions of customers and thousands of restaurants and riders rely on us to match them within milliseconds. The algorithms behind that marketplace are the secret sauces that allow us to deliver our orders in under 30 minutes.
And we're just getting started.
The scale of the opportunity ahead of us is immense. The global food market is valued at £7.7 trillion but only 1% of it is currently online. Contrast that with the digital disruption of countless other industries - from banking and travel to retail and communications - it's clear that our journey in the food sector has only just begun.
We are already a multi-billion dollar company that is more than doubling in size every year. Deliveroo came top in the FT's' list of Europe's fastest growing 1000 companies in 2018, and we were the first company ever to win Deloitte's 'UK Top 50' two years in a row. Yet most of the extraordinary value this company will generate lies ahead of us.

The Role

The Data Services team builds (and maintains) services, tools and infrastructure for the Data Platform, used by the Engineering Organization at Deliveroo.

We are involved in the production readiness of inter-service communication infrastructure as well as for data pipelines in support of machine learning, analytics and data-intensive applications. We set the overall engineering strategy for the integrity, reliability and timeliness of critical business data from the point where it's generated through to multiple, varied business use cases. People in our team use software and systems engineering skills to design and debug complex distributed systems. You could be a good fit to join us if you are comfortable working with unfamiliar codebases, including internal, open source and 3rd party code we depend on.
Our skills

We need skilled software engineers who enjoy solving infrastructure and data problems with code. We don't expect you to meet all of the below but would love you to have experience in some of these areas.
Pride in readable, well-designed, well-tested software
Experience with various data technologies, in particular analytics, aggregation, search and streaming technologies such as Spark, ElasticSearch and MPP data warehouses, Flink, Kafka and Kafka Streams.
Experience with operating systems, configuration management and ""Infrastructure as Code"". (We use AMIs, Docker Images, Terraform and Kubernetes).
Experience with monitoring Web applications (We use Datadog, Sentry).
Our core applications involve use of Scala, so we're looking for engineers with experience in JVM programming languages in production environments (Java or Kotlin would also be appropriate), and use of relevant frameworks (Akka, FS2).
Experience in data engineering type roles that involve partnering with others in the product/application space to ensure that data is treated like a 1st class citizen from the outset of product development.
Professional experience writing infrastructure services and applications in any language, and a willingness to quickly get up to speed on the wider Deliveroo engineering stack (Ruby/Rails, Go and, Python).
Experience with VMs, containers and serverless compute platforms. (We use AWS for compute, e.g. EC2, ECS and Lambda).
Ability to work with unfamiliar codebases, including internal, open source and 3rd party code we depend on.
Life at Deliveroo
We are a growing team, with a very large impact, seeking to solve some of the most interesting challenges out there. We move fast, we're always looking for new ideas and the entire company is very transparent about the decisions we make and why we make them.
There are so many questions we need to answer and plenty more we haven't even encountered. How do data and technology help restaurants to grow as consumer habits change? How can we predict what someone wants to order for dinner long before the idea has even crossed their mind? At Deliveroo these are just some of the tough problems we are solving - and there is no challenge that cannot be yours to work on. No solution is owned by a particular team, which means the scope for growth and personal impact is enormous.
Benefits and Diversity
At Deliveroo we know that people are the heart of the business and we prioritise their welfare. We offer a wide range of competitive benefits in areas including health, family, finance, community, convenience, growth, time away and relocation.
In 2018 we announced our decision to give every employee equity in the company. We did this because we wanted all of our employees, regardless of location, level or role, to be owners and because we believe that this is the right thing to do. We believe this helps build a culture where everyone is committed and able to share in the company's success.
We believe a great workplace is one that represents the world we live in and how beautifully diverse it can be. That means we have no judgement when it comes to any one of the things that make you who you are - your gender, race, sexuality, religion or a secret aversion to coriander. All you need is a passion for (most) food and a desire to be part of one of the fastest growing start-ups around."

About the job
Google's software engineers develop the next-generation technologies that change how billions of users connect, explore, and interact with information and one another. Our products need to handle information at massive scale, and extend well beyond web search. We're looking for engineers who bring fresh ideas from all areas, including information retrieval, distributed computing, large-scale system design, networking and data storage, security, artificial intelligence, natural language processing, UI design and mobile; the list goes on and is growing every day. As a software engineer, you will work on a specific project critical to Google’s needs with opportunities to switch teams and projects as you and our fast-paced business grow and evolve. We need our engineers to be versatile, display leadership qualities and be enthusiastic to take on new problems across the full-stack as we continue to push technology forward.
As a Software Engineer, you will work to build privacy-safe infrastructure that enables server-side data processing in a provably private and externally verifiable way.
We mostly work on server-side technologies, but we also think hard about the usability and legibility of the APIs we create and how they are used by clients in a way that upholds the overall privacy guarantees of the system.
We use cutting-edge technologies, and aim to bridge the gap between open source and google3 development, with the goal of enabling full transparency of how user data is worked with server side.
We have the goal to become a de facto way that provably private experiences are created in technology.
Google is an engineering company at heart. We hire people with a broad set of technical skills who are ready to take on some of technology's greatest challenges and make an impact on users around the world. At Google, engineers not only revolutionize search, they routinely work on scalability and storage solutions, large-scale applications and entirely new platforms for developers around the world. From Google Ads to Chrome, Android to YouTube, social to local, Google engineers are changing the world one technological achievement after another.
Responsibilities
Design and implement Trusted Runtime (an open source and fully reproducibly buildable binary). Make a platform for provably private computation in Google and extend the platform to allow third party developers to develop and deploy privacy-preserving applications.
Research novel mechanisms for enforcing privacy-preserving computation in the context of untrusted code.
Collaborate with other teams in Google to adopt the platform to their use cases.
Deploy and maintain infrastructure that allows running the Trusted Runtime in a reliable and scalable way in order to provide privacy guarantees to first party products.
Participate in the wider security research community (e.g. writing papers, giving presentations, attending conferences, etc).
Google is proud to be an equal opportunity workplace and is an affirmative action employer. We are committed to equal employment opportunity regardless of race, color, ancestry, religion, sex, national origin, sexual orientation, age, citizenship, marital status, disability, gender identity or Veteran status. We also consider qualified applicants regardless of criminal histories, consistent with legal requirements. See also Google's EEO Policy and EEO is the Law. If you have a disability or special need that requires accommodation, please let us know by completing our Accommodations for Applicants form."

As a Senior Software Engineer, you will be responsible for architecting, implementing and deploying software services from end to end. You’ll produce clean, scalable, and reusable code to build products which will have a big impact on our customers.
You will have the opportunity to work with a modern stack and serverless cloud infrastructure whilst guiding and mentoring more junior engineers in the team.
*
What Excites You*
Contributing towards the design, delivery and deployment of large scale, complex projects which are used heavily by thousands of people with high throughput.
Using modern technology like AWS serverless infrastructure and events driven microservice architecture
Mentoring more junior members of the team to help support their growth and development and to ensure the team is levelling up.
Being a subject matter expert on technology and domain-specific problems, and taking ownership of software services from end to end.
Improving responsiveness and overall performance of our web services.
Helping to scale the team by leading on technical interviews.
What Excites Us
Around 5+ years of Software Engineering experience architecting and developing new services and features from end to end.
The ability to take ownership of design and architecture of large scale systems and developing API heavy software solutions without the need for guidance.
A passion for promoting software engineering best practice, guiding and mentoring more junior engineers to deliver clean, scalable, and reusable code.
Proactively contributing to the continual improvement of our engineering processes
Some of the project you could be working on:
Integration into all physical stores and merchants with POS. Consumers can spend their value where they want to as we go beyond Gift Cards.
Continued development of our infrastructure. Transitioning to serverless infrastructure and microservices to enable us to scale rapidly as a team
Building a brand new internal tool chain. So non technical teams can on-board new payment partners
Building our wallet feature. Consumers can aggregate the value they accumulate and spend that digital value when and where they choose to.
Technical resilience. As we become more integral to our customers’ businesses, how can we make sure that we can continue to serve them even when there are technical or logistics issues upstream.
Recent examples of new features:
WeGift Select. This allows us to give the customer choice, and therefore go beyond simply reselling gift cards and towards our strategic vision of helping value to flow more freely in the global economy. This project was technically challenging due to a requirement for it to work across a wide selection of devices.
Self-serve brand on-boarding. WeGift is growing rapidly, which means we have to challenge ourselves to use technology to give a great experience to our brand partners without them needing a lot of support from the customer success team.
Ongoing integration with gift card processors. Right at the heart of WeGift’s operations, this technology needs to scale seamlessly and maintain high standards of reliability, maintainability and security. We’re also constantly asking ourselves how we can make this process more efficient - how can we make a capital investment now to reduce operational spend in the future, and that in turn requires a creative take on the underlying technology.
Benefits

We recognise that engineering managers lead in different ways, we're looking for someone who has:
The ability to communicate clearly and effectively, both in writing and verbally.
Comfort operating with ambiguous problem areas with a high degree of autonomy
A focus on outcomes over processes, who optimises for the highest impact and leverage.
The ability to input, understand and challenge engineering decisions - but to empower the team to make those decisions themselves.

A 1 hour call with someone from our senior engineering leadership team. We'll ask you questions about your current and previous roles, as well as what a high performing team looks like for you, and how you've helped create them in the past.
A 3 stage final-round interview, split between a collaboration with one of our engineers on a technical exercise, as well as management and leadership interviews.
We may follow up with a final stage interview, to discuss any feedback before making a final decision.
At all stages we'll create space for you to ask as many questions as you have, you're interviewing us as well!
We support a flexible working environment, and support managers who wish to be based from our London office, or work remotely from the UK.
We're an equal opportunity employer and prize diversity as a strength. Everyone is welcome at Monzo. We're keen to ensure we're designing a bank that works for everyone, so we particularly encourage applications from different underrepresented demographics.
What is engineering management like at Monzo?
Monzo is a product, engineering and design led business, with a global ambition.
We're building a bank for and with our users. A product that's fair, transparent and a pleasure to use. We see ourselves as something more than a typical current account: we're setting out to solve all the problems that exist around your financial life in a coherent, meaningful and delightful way.
You'll be working on a product that is a part of day to day life for more than five million people already, and your work here will shape the way that people interact with their finances.
Engineers and Engineering Managers at Monzo are part of cross-functional, autonomous teams and groups. Our teams are mission driven, and typically include Product Managers, backend, web and mobile engineers as well as data scientists, designers and subject matter experts relevant to that mission. Teams are organised into groups, and then collectives - we aim to keep our line management structure as shallow as possible, and for teams to directly own decision making relevant to their work.
Engineering Managers are accountable for the technical and delivery outcomes for their area - that means supporting and developing best in class engineering talent, as well as creating an inclusive team environment for people to do their best work. You'll be responsible for structuring, organising, supporting and challenging your team to deliver on their mission.

Our goal is to be the global provider for connected devices in smart buildings. We already handle millions of events every day from tens of thousands of sensors and we’d like you to help us scale that by an order of magnitude over the coming months.

Sustainability is at our heart; buildings account for 39% of global carbon emissions and we’re creating real solutions to impact this!

We are still early in our journey but have already achieved a lot; we raised a successful series A funding round, grew 5x in employee numbers within 12 months, and voted one of the top 10 most flexible places to work.

Want to know more about how we're building Infogrid? Our CTO wrote a blog post about this.

What are we looking for?
Here at Infogrid, we love an automation first approach when it comes to QA, so at the forefront of what we’re looking for is an analytical approach that asks “how can we automate this?” rather than “how can we test this?”.

You’ll work as part of a small QA team, and be integrated within a scrum team composed of product owners, developers, dev ops engineers and data scientists.

Our QA’s tasks will involve adding to and maintaining a UI and API test automation suite in Cypress, writing and executing performance tests using Locust, as well as some manual testing effort where required.

Performance testing is a critical part of what we do here, so it's an essential requirement for us when looking at experience. We would also be looking for experience with setup and teardown of data within test runs.

The work will be challenging, but fun and full of variety; you’ll work at the cutting edge of IoT and will learn a huge amount. Most of all, we offer the opportunity to help shape the future of IoT globally.
We think Infogrid is a great place to work - we’re a recently funded and rapidly growing startup so it’s not perfect but:

❤️ Feel good about your work: Infogrid is actively helping big companies reduce their environmental footprint. We also offset everyone’s carbon footprint.
We’re flexible: We encourage remote working and offer flexible working hours before COVID and we’ll keep that flexibility afterward.
Learn and get promoted: Join us at the start of our journey - we’re growing quickly and believe in promoting from within. You can learn and grow your career here
Improve yourself: We give everyone a day per month to focus on personal development
‍‍ Make friends: Everyone here is lovely
Added bonus: We give everyone options in the company.
Join a legitimately secure tech start-up: $15.5M funding round is great of course but more importantly we have real paying customers and a good, growing revenue stream.

And we'll do everything we can to support you during your application. If you need us to make any adjustments to your recruitment process, speak to our recruitment team who will be happy to support you.

So that’s us. If you love the idea of building something great that makes the world a better place, in a slightly chaotic but consistently entertaining environment please do get in touch via the apply button."

Why Sigma Labs?
There are loads of companies that look like us: FDM, Sparta, Futureproof, Digital Futures, Kubrick, Xandertalent, M3, QA, etc. all promise pretty much the same thing: 6 to 12 week technical training (free), then hopefully a 2 year job with a salary between £21k and £30k working with one of their clients (and if you leave in that period you have to pay back the cost of the training, usually £10k to £20k);
So why us?
Judge us by what we say and do: start with how many companies tell you about their competitors;
We are a start-up education b-corp that invests in people through world class training: this does not mean we’ll teach you what you want to learn, for example if you dead set on only being a ‘full stack java developer’, then we’re probably not right for you. We focus on technology consultants (primarily teaching software & data engineering but covering a large number of roles from software development to test engineers). In addition we cover high performance professional skills (based on the Bain graduate programme) that will enable you to excel longer terms. As you excel, our clients excel and we recover the cost of the training.
We have worked at and our investors come from some of the world’s most renowned companies, from BCG & McKinsey to Unilever, The Guardian and Google. We are all driven by interested in high performance;
What we offer?
The Training: a free 12 to 16 week intense programme covering software & data engineering: from JavaScript, SQL and Python to industry best practices (OOP, TDD & Agile). As important is the training in high performance personal & professional behaviour (from interviewing to problem solving);
The Role: after the training our laser focus is to find you a client and employ you on a £30,000 salary. You’ll work with our clients for 2 years helping them solve real world problems, while we continue to develop you technically & professionally. If we fail to find you a role with us, we’ll still try and help you find a role somewhere;
The Goal: at the end of the 2 years working for us, you'll join our network: >100 senior managers at some of the world's leading organisations, all committed to help Sigma Labs alumni long term. You should be able to earn £40k+ at this point.
What we're looking for?
The key is not the subject but that you do these things yourself. This is how you would honestly describe yourself:
A Problem Solver: logical, mathematical, scientific, philosophical, human….you name it;
A Good Communicator: this doesn’t mean charisma. You put effort into being understood;
Conscientious: you like doing great work for other people - a combination of ambition & niceness;
Curious: you’re interested in things - from coding to plants or languages to crypto;
Persistent: you don’t get phased by problems. You know to break them down, not give up and learn.
Eligibility Criteria: you must have…
Economic: at least one of the following: grown up in a household with income < £43k, attended a non-academically selective state school, been eligible for free school meals or local authority care;
Education:
2:2 or higher (the subject isn’t important but you’re comfortable with numbers); or if you didn’t get a 2:2 or higher but still graduated, then you received at least an A or B in one STEM subject. We need to know that you’re ok with numbers and enjoy solving problems;
Right to work in the UK: UK Passport, EU/EEA Settled Status, Indefinite Leave to Remain (unfortunately we cannot sponsor Visas).
Location: the training will be predominantly online but we will also invite you to our London office at times as face-to-face interactions are difficult to beat.
The Application Process: Apply for our March 2022 or July 2022 cohort now! We provide clear tips on how to do well on the application but you can also easily book a quick call if you’d like to find out more. Please note that applications are considered on a first-come first-serve basis.

We're a modern agent built for movers, the first estate agent to support both the selling and buying process with everything in between. We can even make sellers chain-free, with our cash advance securing their ideal home before they sell.
We are a wildly ambitious team, backed by Europe’s leading VCs and led by an experienced, hands-on founding team. We're all contributing remotely to build a new era for home movers, with plans to optionally work from home 3 days of the week in the future when we can spend some time in our Farringdon office again. And when work is over, there’s plenty of socialising, from film nights to sports days.
If redefining an entire industry is a challenge that motivates you, come and join the team at Nested.
The product team:
Our team's mission is to create the best tools in the industry. We break that down into two pillars:
We want to build the best customer account for home sellers on Android and iPhone and web, providing visibility into what is traditionally a low-trust, emotionally fraught process and delightful flows to remove friction like constant phone calls.
We want to build the best agency platform: one that gives Nested agents superpowers and allows them to focus on what matters most - providing fantastic customer service.
Requirements:
We are looking for someone who:
Likes to get things done, that merge button is so satisfying.
Is motivated by a great product that makes a difference, solving problems for people through technology.
Is empathetic and good with people, able to manage stakeholders and mentor other engineers.
Is keen to learn.
May have an interest in either management or in being a technical expert one day.
They will:
Spend time with our product managers figuring out what our next great product feature will be.
Deliver features end-to-end, including what to measure, what v1 looks like and what success looks like. We use a process called feature leading to do that.
Use, or learn to use, our tech stack, Elixir, GraphQL and React. We are language agnostic in our hiring. We like to optimise for simplicity, and write code for the next engineer.
Help improve our diversity by contributing to workshops we run. We teach elixir to various groups.
Work at and learn to run a startup. We’ve already helped a few folks chase their own dreams!
On a day-to-day basis they could be:
Having business impact - by leading and contributing to new features as part of a cross-functional team, pairing with other engineers where it makes sense.
Having technical impact - by ensuring our tech estate is not a blocker to our business goals and engaging with cross-team architectural decisions.
Having an impact on your team - by coaching, mentoring, teaching, helping to break down tasks into small manageable chunks, reviewing others’ code, and make sure we’re giving and receiving feedback regularly.
Helping to improve our teams' well-being - for example by organising a social or two.
Helping to improve our brand - for example by blogging, running a work experience day for local school children or mentoring an intern for a few months.
Benefits:
Salary between £70k and £90k per annum based on experience.
Generous options grant with further options awarded at reviews depending on performance.
4% employer pension contribution.
Private health insurance with gym discounts & more.
27 days holiday + bank holidays.
Work From Home 3 days a week, and flexible working hours. (though we are fully remote right now)
£1,000 personal development budget per year.
Generous maternity package, 16 weeks full pay.
Generous paternity package, 4 weeks paternity leave.
Should these packages not suit you, we are happy to discuss alternatives.
Monthly team social events.
Plus, if you’re ever buying or selling a home, we're pretty good at that as well and employees get it at a discount.
Interview process:
Stage 1: A chat with one of our engineering team, where we get to learn more about one another and see if the role is a good fit for both parties.
Stage 2: A live coding session with one of the engineers in the team you'd work in. Partly in a language of your choice, partly in Elixir (we'll send you some learning materials ahead of time so you only have to learn a subset of the language). All on your machine in your most comfortable coding environment. We want to see how you learn and how you perform when comfortable.
Stage 3: Two culture & values fit interviews with Matthew our Head of Product and one other.
We are striving to build a diverse and inclusive team, but we recognise there is always more to be done. In the last year, we’ve focused on running workshops in collaboration with tech bootcamps, promoting self-education through our anti-racism reading list (among other reading lists), sponsoring work visas and building diversity into the engineering growth framework. If you would like to talk to us about these efforts, or have suggestions for how we can do better, we would love to hear from you.
Nested is proud to be an equal opportunities employer: At Nested we embrace diversity and see it as a benefit to our company. That's why we're committed to hiring top talent regardless of race, religion, colour, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, age or status as an individual with a disability.

Mountain Warehouse is a profitable and privately-owned business. The development department is focussed on getting things done rather than predicting when things will get done. What does this mean? It means that:
Exciting changes in the business can appear at short notice.
If we need something and it’s reasonably-priced, we can usually just get it.
You can suggest ideas that can change the business.
We’re light on meetings!
The department at Mountain Warehouse is split into many small teams responsible for the applications relevant to an area of the business (i.e. product-focussed teams). We work to improve the eCommerce offering internationally, to improve our tools & processes for buying, merchandising, retail operations, logistics, customer service, finance, etc…
Development process
At Mountain Warehouse we believe that developers should be connected to the things that they build – as such, developers get to spend time with the business owners on a regular basis and specifications are built iteratively based upon feedback. We take the time to get things right rather than rushing on to the next thing. All code is peer reviewed and TDD is promoted as much as possible.
A selection of the technologies we use
C# (.net Core and .net Framework)
TypeScript / JavaScript
SQL Server
RabbitMQ / MassTransit
Entity Framework
Microservices architecture
MongoDB
React
RESTful APIs
Azure
Jenkins / Continuous Delivery
Docker
Some teams are mostly considered “backend” but most teams are working as full-stack. As such, we would expect you to have exposure to a modern typed language (C#, Java, TypeScript) and ideally JavaScript.
Support You Will Receive
We are putting together a training pathway for all new junior starters – so expect your first few months to involve a lot of internal & external workshops and a decent amount of study time. We trust this will quickly give you the knowledge you need to be working on our production systems.
You will experience working in at least two different teams while at Mountain Warehouse and will have someone to mentor you on a daily basis during that time. Over the course of the whole year you will also get regular check-ins from the dedicated YINI Lead.
Office & Culture
Our IT department is based in a modern office building over the road from the rest of the company, it’s a stone’s throw from Victoria which gives you easy transport links to Clapham High St, Soho, Camden, Brixton, Shoreditch, Notting Hill, etc. All the team is constantly learning, and we have a dedicated day every month for training – we also have regular lunch’n’learn events and twice-yearly hack events.
We have recently changed so that the team is a mix of remote and on-site developers. We think you will get the most out of working in our office (after Coronavirus), but it is not a requirement and any team events will be conducted in a remote-first way.
The team is sociable and we fully expect that atmosphere to return when we are once again back in the office.
What’s in it for you?
Competitive salary and benefits package
Holiday allowance
50% staff discount & 25% for family and friends
Pension scheme
In 1997, we launched Mountain Warehouse to make the outdoors accessible to everyone by offering value for money product and exemplary customer service.
The outdoor industry had become very jargon heavy and we wanted to create a brand that would cater to our mothers and our neighbour’s kids as well as seasoned professionals who understood the technology.
Our expansion since then has seen the brand grow and the product evolve, but the small family business that makes MW special has remained. Great product is at the heart of everything we do.
As we expand internationally we employ a team of dedicated diverse people to offer our valued customers the best possible experience when visiting our stores, shopping online and putting our range through its paces.
Welcome to our journey.

An understanding of continuous integration and continuous delivery practices.
Contributions to the technical community, either through blogs, internal workshops, meetups or conferences.

Operating like an “internal start up”, we’ve already done a lot to be proud of, such as:
Designing products that can explain complex data landscapes and insights to our users
Building frameworks and libraries for data scientists and data engineers to work in large-scale, complex projects. We open-sourced some of these frameworks, such as our award-winning Kedro or CasualNex
Codifying the methodology by which we deliver advanced analytics projects to our clients and the tooling needed to support them
What our developers particularly enjoy about QuantumBlack Labs:
Autonomy– Your users sit on the desk next to you, giving you unparalleled insight into key problems and the ability to design solutions iteratively, with literally rapid feedback.

Variety & Ownership Mindset– You’ll be part of an ecosystem of very different products, providing unique learning and development opportunities. You’ll not be just an engineer but a core part of the product team driving product decisions using your engineering creativity, where you’ll interact with users, work with designers and product managers, give presentations and talks.

Who you are:
A core value at QuantumBlack is collaboration and at the heart of our multi-disciplinary teams is the belief that the impact of the entire team is greater than the sum of its individual parts.
You are a highly collaborative individual who is capable of laying aside your own agenda, listening to and learning from colleagues, challenging thoughtfully and prioritising impact.

Healthcare Efficiency – We helped a healthcare provider improve their clinical trial practices by identifying congestion in diagnostic testing as a key indicator of admissions breaches.
Environmental Impact – We designed and built the first data-driven application for a state of the art centre of excellence in urban innovation by collecting real-time data from environmental sensors across London and deploying proprietary analytics to find unexpected patterns in air pollution.

Millions of customers and thousands of restaurants and riders rely on us to match them within milliseconds…","Why Deliveroo?
When you first think about Deliveroo, you probably think of getting great food to your house in less than half an hour. Awesome right? But behind the scenes is the real story. This story is one of high growth, huge challenges and an enormous opportunity ahead of us. It began with our founder Will, arriving in London in 2004 and finding it almost impossible to order great food, despite the wealth of incredible restaurants in the city. In 2013 Deliveroo was launched. Fast forward to 2020 and we operate in 12 markets with over 60,000 riders who deliver orders from 60,000 restaurants in over 500 cities worldwide.
We want to be the definitive food company - the app you go to any time you have a hunger pang. We are transforming the way people think about food. We are providing people with limitless access to different cuisines and restaurants, turning cooking from a chore to a choice, and giving people the freedom to eat what they want, when they want, where they want it.
We work with riders, restaurants and consumers. We operate one of the most complex three sided marketplaces in the world and we do this in real time. Millions of customers and thousands of restaurants and riders rely on us to match them within milliseconds. The algorithms behind that marketplace are the secret sauce that allows us to deliver our orders in around 30 minutes.
And we're just getting started.
The scale of the opportunity ahead of us is immense. The global food market is valued at £7.7 trillion but only 1% of it is currently online. Contrast that with the digital disruption of countless other industries - from banking and travel to retail and communications - it's clear that our journey in the food sector has only just begun.
We are already a multi-billion pound company that has grown rapidly. Deliveroo came top in the FT's' list of Europe's fastest growing 1000 companies in 2018, and we were the first company ever to win Deloitte's 'UK Top 50' two years in a row. Yet most of the extraordinary value this company will generate lies ahead of us.
The Role
Work as part of a full stack product team to develop solutions to ensure optimal experiences for our customers, riders, and restaurants
Utilise a variety of backend technologies to build scalable products
You'll take part in decisions related to how we undertake new projects
You'll gather requirements and scope out projects with the rest of the team
Our skills include:
We want to emphasise that we don't expect you to meet all of the below but would love you to have experience in some of these areas.
Pride in readable, well-designed, well-tested software
Professional experience writing web-based applications in any language, and a willingness to quickly get up to speed on our stack (Ruby/Rails, Go, Python, Scala, or Rust)
Experience with TDD environments (RSpec, Minitest, Capybara, Selenium)
Experience with relational databases (PostGreSQL, MySQL) and key-value stores (Memcache, Redis)
Experience with front-end web technology, bonus points for React
Experience with web architecture at scale (20krpm and above)
Experience with PostGIS, or any geography-heavy applications
Experience with ""NoSQL"" data backends (Redis, MongoDB, ElasticSearch)
Experience solving logistical problems with software
Life at Deliveroo
We are a growing team, with very large impact, seeking to answer some of the most interesting questions out there. We move fast, we're always looking for new ideas and we're very transparent about the decisions we make and why we make them.
There are so many questions we need to answer and plenty more we haven't even encountered. How do data and technology help restaurants to grow as consumer habits change? How can we predict what someone wants to order for dinner long before the idea has even crossed their mind? At Deliveroo these are just some of the tough problems we are solving - and there is no challenge that cannot be yours. No solution is owned by a particular team, which means the scope for growth and personal impact is enormous.
Diversity
We believe a great workplace is one that represents the world we live in and how beautifully diverse it can be. That means we have no judgement when it comes to any one of the things that make you who you are - your gender, race, sexuality, religion or a secret aversion to coriander. All you need is a passion for (most) food and a desire to be part of one of the fastest growing start-ups around."

There’s no one-size-fits all solution when it comes to how often we get together in person, so all of our people and teams find the rhythm that suits them best when it comes to working from home or hub.
We’re innovative We've created a place for people to be curious, experience new things, and bring unique ideas to the table. If you want to learn how we do all this - head over to our Careers page where you’ll see us walk the talk

If Simply Business sounds like the kind of place you’ll thrive, we’d love to hear from you.

We need a Software Engineer to join us in London

Our Tech Stack: Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Scala, MongoDB, Spark, AWS, Docker, Kafka, Terraform, JavaScript, SCSS, React, Webpack
As a Software Engineer you’ll:
develop customer-focused products in a culture that champions Agile, cross functional teams and continuous collaboration
Responsibilities include:
being hands-on in developing our products using best practices, appropriate tools and technologies
working with cross functional collaborative teams, helping to clarify requirements at the onset of projects and suggesting different and relevant technical approaches
championing Agile processes whilst creating amazingly useful systems in a collaborative way for our customers
highlighting areas for continuous improvement and driving their prioritisation
being proactive in suggesting new tools, technologies and ways of working.
What we’re looking for:
strong programming skills in any language. We look for strong Engineers and our philosophy is that a strong Engineer is not defined by the technologies they use; therefore Ruby experience is not essential. You’ll just need to be happy to cross-over to Ruby if you join us – and we will support you with that
the ability to communicate complex technical concepts to both tech and non-tech colleagues
understanding and appreciation of Agile methodologies
strong desire to work collaboratively with business teams. We do not divide ‘business’ and tech’ teams, we see both as one team as we are all working towards one shared goal
strong interpersonal skills to work well in our very open and friendly environment
pro-active in suggesting new tools, processes and technologies – anything which will help us continually improve!
Our culture is inclusive and diverse

Our mission is to make Simply Business synonymous with fairness, belonging and inclusivity. We won’t be happy until we’ve created a truly inclusive culture – where every employee, whatever their background, role, or location, feels comfortable being their authentic self at work.

We all have a part to play – to learn more, to do more and to go further – in building this new reality that’ll be befitting of the diversity of the customers we serve. At Simply Business, we’re all in.

What are the benefits?

At Simply Business, our benefits let you balance life and work properly:

flexible parental leave – you can choose to take shared parental leave, plus we offer full pay for the first six months of your maternity leave and four-week fully paid paternity leave, subject to meeting the qualifying criteria
remote working – more of us are currently working remotely than usual, but longer-term you can balance working remotely with working in the office, giving you the opportunity to connect with colleagues
mental health and wellbeing resources – we take your wellbeing seriously, giving you access to counselling (through our Employee Assistance Programme) as well as technology to support your mental health (through the Unmind app)
paid sabbatical – two weeks off when you’ve been here for five years and four weeks off when you’ve been here for 10 years
a dedicated learning platform – including a management and leadership programme – the platform lets you balance both work and life goals

And we compensate you fairly:

a competitive salary that reflects your experience, our pay policy and the market we’re in from your first day
the potential to earn an annual bonus based on business performance (those on commission-led roles will be rewarded monthly)
we match what you put into your pension up to five per cent
a health cash plan reimburses your everyday medical expenses (with the opportunity to increase the level of your plan in your flexible benefits)
a generous holiday entitlement of 25 days annual leave, plus bank holidays
life assurance of four times of your basic salary
Smart Health services including unlimited access to a 24/7 virtual GP
a flexible benefits scheme with an allocated allowance each year to choose from benefits including private medical insurance, dental insurance, travel insurance, up to five days extra holiday, and gym membership

These values are important to us and our people
Learning
Empowerment
Authenticity
Pioneering
Simplicity

These all mean something unique to every person at Simply Business, but if you’re thinking about working here, give them some thought. They’re at the heart of our story."

Identifying DevOps opportunities to streamline the deployment pipeline and increase the ability of the team to be in control
Refactoring and migrating legacy code
Understanding the capabilities and usage of other systems, including the Amex Big Data platform
Troubleshooting problems by debugging and log analysis, and identifying ways to avoid or simplify troubleshooting through improvements to monitoring, alerting and self-correcting code
Taking full part in agile activities and working with an agile mindset of continuous improvement

Required Qualifications & Experience:
Ability to create clean, high quality, well designed and well tested code in one or more languages

An understanding of security of data in transit and at rest, and an appreciation of application security vulnerabilities and how they may be mitigated

You will primarily be writing clean, well-tested front end code across all sites and a range of projects, supporting our existing 2 frontend developers who will help you learn and develop.
However whilst we want somebody to learn and build their knowledge and experience, we don’t want somebody who will simply be told what to do. We are looking for somebody who is passionate about our products and how your improvements will help the company grow.
These could range from AB tests to improve conversion, to larger projects which help define our product strategy - we are an incredibly flexible company and your suggestions should also help shape our product roadmap.
You will work within our frontend development team, contributing to what technologies we should be employing to ensure that our frontend offers a best in class user experience but is also technically efficient, sharing knowledge and learning from one another - don't worry if this is not something you'll be contributing on day one, but we want somebody who wants to learn, develop and contribute within a small team.
Probably a few other things, we’re a startup after all!
The person
We’re looking for somebody who is not only technically capable of writing strong code, but also cares about the user experience and fits in well in the work environment. If you’re more junior, you won't be expected to know everything but have enough knowledge to work within the team and progress both collaboratively and alone with instruction. You should have:
A depending upon experience levels, a basic - strong knowledge and experience of our frontend technical stack - HTML5 (HAML will be a plus), CSS/SASS and JS (ES6 & a modern JS framework ideally but open to people who have basic JS understanding and want to learn more).
A general understanding of how backend code (we use Ruby on Rails) interacts with the frontend stack (preferred but not essential).
We’re open to candidates with a range of early experience. From those with a computer science degree or bootcamp with some examples of projects you've worked upon, to those with 2-3 years of commercial experience. Salary levels will, of course, be adjusted in line with experience.
Familiar with working with third party APIs (for payments, maps, etc - again, just a basic understanding is enough here).
An understanding of web accessibility guidelines.
Can write code that works consistently across different browsers and platforms.
Understanding of working with Sketch / Photoshop.
A passion for building beautiful UI and UX.
A dynamic personality and not be afraid to voice your opinion.
Good collaborator and enjoy solving problems, working with our product designer or having technical discussions with colleagues.
Experience in AB testing software such as Optimizely or Google Optimize is a bonus.
The ability to work in person, from our office on the Southbank, on Tuesdays and Thursdays.

Location: London
Salary: Competitive
Why Deliveroo?
When you first think about Deliveroo, you probably think of getting great food to your house in less than half an hour. Awesome right? But behind the scenes is the real story. This story is one of high growth, huge challenges and an enormous opportunity ahead of us. It began with our founder Will, arriving in London in 2004 and finding it almost impossible to order great food, despite the wealth of incredible restaurants in the city. In 2013 Deliveroo was launched. Fast forward to 2020 and we operate in 12 markets with over 60,000 riders who deliver orders from 60,000 restaurants in over 500 cities worldwide.
We want to be the definitive food company - the app you go to any time you have a hunger pang. We are transforming the way people think about food. We are providing people with limitless access to different cuisines and restaurants, turning cooking from a chore to a choice, and giving people the freedom to eat what they want, when they want, where they want it.
We work with riders, restaurants and consumers. We operate one of the most complex three sided marketplaces in the world and we do this in real time. Millions of customers and thousands of restaurants and riders rely on us to match them within milliseconds. The algorithms behind that marketplace are the secret sauce that allows us to deliver our orders in around 30 minutes.
And we're just getting started.
The scale of the opportunity ahead of us is immense. The global food market is valued at £7.7 trillion but only 1% of it is currently online. Contrast that with the digital disruption of countless other industries - from banking and travel to retail and communications - it's clear that our journey in the food sector has only just begun.
We are already a multi-billion pound company that has grown rapidly. Deliveroo came top in the FT's' list of Europe's fastest growing 1000 companies in 2018, and we were the first company ever to win Deloitte's 'UK Top 50' two years in a row. Yet most of the extraordinary value this company will generate lies ahead of us.
The Role
Work as part of a full stack product team to develop solutions to ensure optimal experiences for our customers, riders, and restaurants
You'll lead technical decisions related to how we undertake new projects
You'll gather requirements and scope out projects with the rest of the team
You will define and scope out the product roadmap
Mentor and develop other members of the team
Our skills include:
We want to emphasise that we don't expect you to meet all of the below but would love you to have experience in some of these areas.
Pride in readable, well-designed, well-tested software
Professional experience writing web-based applications in any language, and a willingness to quickly get up to speed on our stack (Ruby/Rails, Go, Python, Scala, or Rust)
Experience with TDD environments (RSpec, Minitest, Capybara, Selenium)
Experience with relational databases (PostGreSQL, MySQL) and key-value stores (Memcache, Redis)
Experience with front-end web technology, bonus points for React
Experience with web architecture at scale (20krpm and above)
Experience with PostGIS, or any geography-heavy applications
Experience with ""NoSQL"" data backends (Redis, MongoDB, ElasticSearch)
Experience solving logistical problems with software
Life at Deliveroo
We are a growing team, with very large impact, seeking to answer some of the most interesting questions out there. We move fast, we're always looking for new ideas and we're very transparent about the decisions we make and why we make them.
There are so many questions we need to answer and plenty more we haven't even encountered. How do data and technology help restaurants to grow as consumer habits change? How can we predict what someone wants to order for dinner long before the idea has even crossed their mind? At Deliveroo these are just some of the tough problems we are solving - and there is no challenge that cannot be yours. No solution is owned by a particular team, which means the scope for growth and personal impact is enormous.
Diversity
We believe a great workplace is one that represents the world we live in and how beautifully diverse it can be. That means we have no judgement when it comes to any one of the things that make you who you are - your gender, race, sexuality, religion or a secret aversion to coriander. All you need is a passion for (most) food and a desire to be part of one of the fastest growing start-ups around."

They have since assembled a talented and diverse team of legal, software and machine learning engineers to build the next generation of contracting tools.

At Robin AI, we create groundbreaking products that are transforming legal teams. Our work is multi-disciplinary and brings together the best talent in engineering, AI and the law. Our current product uses neural networks to read and comprehend written contracts, assesses whether they adhere to our customers’ preferred positions, and then automatically amends them. But our ambitions go way beyond reviewing contracts – we want to build technology that changes the way companies all over the world do deals.

To do that, we need to build. Specifically, we want to build a new, structured way for businesses to make and agree contracts by replacing the outdated Microsoft Word workflow with a browser-based, visual contract building application that will empower anyone to create a world class contract without a lawyer. Just like Figma has democratised design tools, and WebFlow has democratised website development, we want to give business owners, HR teams, procurement teams and in-house lawyers all over the world the ability to create and negotiate any business contract by combining legal, design, software and machine learning expertise.

You will help us build software that will allow our customers to create contracts from a library of templates, and quickly review and edit contracts sent to them by counter-parties. You’ll also help us develop our machine learning service which can automatically edit contracts and explain the changes to the user in plain English. And you’ll help us build an intelligent contract repository that will help companies save thousands of hours searching for information trapped inside their contracts. We’ve already made great progress towards this product vision, but you will play a pivotal role in making it a reality.

Have a background working in a start-up or similar size organisation and are passionate about building high quality products
Have an in-depth understanding of the entire development process (design, development and deployment)

The Genesis software development apprenticeship scheme is targeted at individuals who
have a keen interest in programming and want to jump straight into a career in technology.
This program offers a unique opportunity to combine classroom and work-based learning.
Across the 3-year duration of this program, you’ll spend 20% of your time at Ada, the
National College for Digital Skills, and 80% at Genesis.
At Genesis you’ll be learning on the job, gaining extensive experience and training across many areas of the development lifecycle.
All the work experience you gain here, in addition to the content covered at the
college, will contribute towards a BSc Honours degree in Digital & Technology Solutions.
The key focus of this scheme is on your personal development, from essential technical and coding skills, to soft skills such as communication, teamwork, organisation and problem-solving.

Innovative thinking and problem-solving – thinking differently when you encounter
problems and not being afraid to trial new ways of thinking.

deadlines whilst maintaining high work quality standards.
Proactive approach to work – you are a self-starter who embraces new challenges.
Communication (both verbal and written) – you are confident in building and

areas for development.

About the employer
Genesis is a software development company with a difference. We use low code (a
development approach allowing clients to create software applications faster and without as
high-level programming knowledge) to sell our platform and applications to banks and other
financial institutions.
In the last year we have more than doubled in size, so it is an exciting time for us as we
continue on our growth journey. We are looking for talented people, who share our passions,
to join us. We combine the best of big company benefits with the ability to really make a
difference, and we strive to ensure that everyone has the opportunity to learn and grow.

Deliveroo came top in the FT's' list of Europe's fastest growing 1000 companies in 2018, and we were the first company ever to win Deloitte's 'UK Top 50' two years in a row.

Lindus Health is looking for a Principal Software Engineer to build the platform powering the next generation of clinical trials. We want to add a very experienced engineer to our small team to do hands-on product development, drive long-term architecture and evolve our engineering practices as the team grows.
About us
Clinical trials are in crisis. The industry hasn't changed in 30 years, and the cost of bringing new medicines to market is skyrocketing as a result.
Lindus Health’s mission is to fix this. We accelerate clinical trials, so patients can benefit. We’re building the world’s first full stack clinical trial platform, to conduct faster, safer clinical trials on behalf of companies developing new treatments, and lowering the barriers to participation for patients.
Since launching the company in March 2021 we have helped find over 5,000 patients for more than 25 clinical trials in areas like type 2 diabetes, COVID-19 diagnostics and mental health. We closed a $5m seed round to grow our platform and team.

About you
You have at least 7 years of experience as a software engineer. This includes at least 1 year in a role that could be characterized as “senior+” - a role where you acted as a tech lead for a project with multiple engineers or where you demonstrated impact across multiple teams or functions.
You are comfortable working across a stack that includes frontend (TypeScript/React), backend (Python/Django/Postgres) and infrastructure (AWS). You don’t necessarily have hands-on experience with all pieces of our stack but are happy to pick up technology that’s new to you.
You are product-minded: you want to understand why we are building something to figure out the best how in collaboration with product managers, trial managers and users. You like to iterate on features based on user feedback.
You are an excellent listener and communicator who can build consensus, drive decisions and resolve conflicts. You write clearly and know when to deploy written artifacts to move teams and projects along.
You like an early-stage startup environment where you have lots of autonomy and opportunities to grow your skills. You want to have a major impact on architecture and engineering practices as we grow from a small team to a large organization.
You belong here! If your experience and interests match with some of the above, we want you to apply.
Why join the Lindus Health team?
Be part of the founding team on a mission to change the way healthcare operates!
£80K - 95K base salary, plus 0.3 - 0.5% equity in stock options
Unlimited holidays; everyone is encouraged to take at least 28 days off each year
Flexible office arrangement; come into the office in London as often as you like, or work remotely within the UK
If working mostly remotely: regular all-expenses paid trips to London to see the whole team (pandemic permitting)
Monthly team events and days out, recently we've been to Legoland, and a Millwall FC home game (decided by popular vote)
Up to £500 towards setting up your home office
A new laptop as your main workstation
UK visa sponsorship if you’re not already eligible to work in the UK
What you will do
In your first month:
Learn about clinical trials and the problems we are trying to solve from our co-founders, medical lead and trial managers
Get your development environment set up, figure out a starter project with the team, make your first commits and your first deploys
Start participating in the regular product development cycle with the product & engineering team
Within your first year:
Collaborate with our trial partners and users to iterate on features they are using as well as to discover and ship new features
Take on technical leadership for a major product area and work with co-founders & product managers to set the product direction
Facilitate long-term architecture and design decisions with the whole engineering team
Evolve engineering practices and work on making the team more productive in areas such as testing, CI, deployment pipelines, cloud infrastructure
Help grow the product & engineering team by interviewing candidates, onboarding new hires and mentoring other engineers
Our technology strategy
Collaboration rocks. We like processes that emphasize openness and knowledge sharing across disciplines, across hierarchies and across time. We acknowledge that sharing, discussing and documenting their work means a certain amount of overhead for individuals, but this is more than offset in the long run by a culture of healthy teams and individual growth.
Iterate with abandon. We recognize that we often don’t know what the heck we’re doing when we start working on a new feature or technical problem, but we know that our understanding will improve as we start down a path to a particular solution. We favor tools and processes that support rapid iteration and frequent validation through user feedback and metrics.
Favor boring technology. We choose languages, frameworks, libraries, architectures and tools that are well-established in order to focus on the part that's hard and exciting and accelerates clinical trials the most: product development. We like a mature technology that has been around for at least a decade with abundant documentation and a large community around it. We deviate from this norm in targeted areas of innovation relevant to the business.
Related reading: Boring Technology (Dan McKinley), Buy vs build (Camille Fournier)
Test in production. We recognize that the last steps of integration and productionization of a new feature are hard - often harder than writing the code in the first place. We favor tools and processes that let us deploy to production early and often and as confidently as possible. We believe that deep insight into how their code behaves with real data and real users is crucial for engineers to get better at their craft.

Our hiring process for engineers
Send your resume to jobs@lindushealth.com. We welcome all applicants regardless of gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, religion, civil or family status, age, disability, or race. If Lindus Health’s mission resonates with you, we want you to apply! We commit to responding to you within 24 hours (weekends and holidays excepted).
Initial call with a co-founder (30 minutes): This is your opportunity to learn more about Lindus Health. We want to tell you about our mission and what we're doing to revolutionise health research.
Technical discussion with Nik, our CTO and a co-founder (90 minutes): This is a session in two parts where we figure out whether your technical skills mesh with our team. We deliberately don’t demand you write code or solve algorithm puzzles in real time, though you have the option to do a coding challenge at your own pace if you like.
Part 1: Code. You can choose between talking about a piece of code you’ve already written or complete a coding challenge at home that we then talk about. In the first option, you share a piece of your code that you think is interesting. We will walk through the code together and discuss your thought process, challenges you’ve faced and potential refactorings. If you choose the second option you get instructions for a coding challenge that you can do at your own pace ahead of the discussion. The challenge is designed to take no more than 2 hours to complete.
Part 2: Architecture & practices. We will share a document with you in advance that explains our team’s current architecture choices and practices. We will discuss what appeals to you about it, what you would change and what you would add to it. As a principal you would be expected to help evolve our architecture and practices.
Systems design & writing assignment (up to 2 hours): We will ask you to write a design document for a system given some basic requirements. You do this at your own pace at home.
Values interview (45 minutes): This is a conversation with 1 or 2 co-founders about our values and culture and also your chance to ask any questions you still have about Lindus Health.
Meeting the team (one or two calls of 30 mins, or an in-person meeting if you’re in London): At this stage you’ll want to get to know more of the people you’ll be working with. We’ll set up informal calls or meet you in person at our office near Victoria station in London.
Offer! If you've come this far, receive an offer and join the team to help us bring about the next generation of healthcare research. We move fast and usually make a decision within hours of your last meeting."

We are always keen to hear from capable, creative engineers who want to help us accomplish that goal
Our backend engineers have a variety of different backgrounds
We have several non-graduates; only some of us studied Computer Science; one of the team has a degree in Marketing; some of us have worked in huge companies; some have only ever worked in startups; others are former consultants. As long as you enjoy learning new things, we'd love to talk to you. We do not ask for formal qualifications or degree requirements for any of our engineering roles.
We are actively creating an equitable environment for all of our engineers to thrive
Diversity and inclusion are a priority for us and we are making sure we have lots of support for all of our people to grow at Monzo. We provide a sponsorship framework in Engineering for women and people of colour; all of our leaders are trained on privilege awareness and we are creating partnerships with organisations dedicated to supporting underrepresented groups. You can read more in our 2020 Diversity and Inclusion report.
We encourage an open and transparent working environment
You can get involved in any aspect of the business you are interested in and, following Stripe's example, all emails in the company are visible in an email archive. We contribute to open source software as much as possible. Our blog is a good place to learn even more about what we do!
Payments
The goal of Payments is to ensure that making and receiving a payment is a seamless, safe and delightful experience. We're at the heart of the bank and own some of the core infrastructure and services that make Monzo, Monzo… Hello Hot Coral Cards
Engineering squads within Payments carry out a mixture of project and operational work to generate revenue, automate manual processes, implement key controls and stay compliant with the various payment schemes we participate in.
Previous payments team projects have included building our very own Mastercard processor (from scratch), replacing a third-party Faster Payments Gateway with our own internal gateway, improving the international money transfer experience for our customers and supporting other teams within Monzo as they build innovative new features and services using our Payments infrastructure e.g. Monzo Flex, virtual cards & Monzo Pay. We've delivered industry leading Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) and 3D Secure V2 (3DSV2) implementations. And we make sure our critical payments infrastructure and services continue to be reliable, correct and high performing.
At the moment we're very interested in finding a specific 'shape' of backend engineer: someone who's had some experience within a payments focused engineering team working with other engineers and disciplines and potentially leading projects. As a senior engineer within payments you should expect to split your time between writing code, designing systems and services, mentoring other engineers, and working with your squad to make project decisions, estimates and risk based prioritisation.
Monzo works in project-based sprints in small, interdisciplinary teams
We have around 150 engineers out of roughly 1,400 people in total - and we have big ambitions. There are many interesting challenges ahead, and we're happy for people to move between teams or to specialise, whatever you prefer. As a senior engineer here you'd be able to work directly with folks from across the company, and we run regular knowledge-sharing sessions so you'll learn heaps about everything from how banks work to effective communication.
At Monzo you will get to work with a lot of exciting new technology.
We rely heavily on the following tools and technologies:

Envoy Proxy for RPC
Kubernetes and Docker to schedule and run our services
AWS for most of our infrastructure
We also have two physical datacenter sites with actual cables to connect to different payment schemes such as Mastercard and SWIFT
You should apply if:
you have strong experience working on the backend of a technology product
you think you'd enjoy the kind of work we're doing
you like doing innovative work under the hood to make things work better
you want to be involved in building and maintaining services that power our award winning bank
you're keen to learn more about new technologies and the arcane inner workings of the payments industry
you're comfortable working in a fast paced environment in a team that deals with ambiguity
you have some experience with strongly-typed languages (Go, Java, C, Scala etc.)
you're strong on systems thinking and distributed design
Bonus points for (but not essential):
Experience working with payment schemes or within the financial services/fintech sector
team and project leadership experience
Logistics
Salary is around £90,000 - £116,000 plus stock options and other benefits.
We can help you relocate to London & we can sponsor visas.
This role can be based in our London office, but we're open to distributed working (with ad hoc meetings in London once COVID is over).
There's no closing date for this job.
We offer flexible working hours and trust you to work enough hours to do your job well, at times that suit you and your team.
Diversity and inclusion is a priority for us – if we want to solve problems for people around the world, our team has to represent our customers. So we need to attract the best talent and create an environment that supports and includes them. You can read more about diversity and inclusion on our blog.
If you prefer to work part-time, we'll make this happen whenever we can - whether this is to help you meet other commitments or strike a great work-life balance.
Our interview process is normally a phone interview, a coding task and call to discuss it, and 2-3 hours of onsite interviews that can be conducted via hangouts as well. We promise not to ask you any brain teasers or trick questions. We might design a system together on a whiteboard, the same way we often work together, but we won't make you write code on one.
Equal Opportunity Statement
At Monzo, embracing diversity in all of its forms and fostering an inclusive environment for all people to do the best work of their lives with us. This is integral to our mission of making money work for everyone.

We’re not just engineering systems, we’re engineering a company. Preserving our culture is the most important thing to us as we scale. It’s the way we come together to find the best solutions, and how we hold ourselves accountable to achieving our vision: delivering success for our customers and meaningful experiences for our people.

Do Something Big: The future promises a lot—the Internet of Everything, smart connected cities, transparent markets, virtual medicine—but these advances require more than what's possible with conventional solutions. We’ve developed a new way to build distributed systems. For over a decade, we’ve used it to build complex trading systems for the world’s largest financial institutions, and now we’re starting to solve real-time problems across every industry.

Blaze Your Own Trail: We’re at an exciting stage—small but growing fast. There are unprecedented opportunities to learn and lead right away.

There is no one path. You’ll have the freedom to follow your interests as they evolve.

Solve Hard Problems: The engineering we do is complex—thousands of globally distributed components, vast amounts of fast-moving shared data, continuous real-time analysis and execution, always-on mission-critical performance. It ordinarily takes years to solve these problems (think aerospace or flight control) but that’s not an option for us. Our fintech executes hundreds of billions of dollars in trades each day, so there’s huge value in launching ideas fast. We invent smarter designs and smarter ways to develop and test, so we can innovate in quick cycles without compromising the exacting requirements inherent to the systems we build.

Be Greater Together: We tackle problems no one could solve alone, so we’re here to learn from each other. Each insight is a springboard for the next. We encourage disagreement to achieve a greater outcome. But solving hard problems is only part of the equation—we hire people who inspire us and enjoy working together. The result is a team that truly “clicks”.

Do the Right Thing: Building a healthy, lasting company starts from the inside out. Our progressive policies and practices foster transparency, integrity, openness, and forward thinking. We are deeply committed to building a company that empowers people, enables them to thrive throughout their careers, and do big things here.

We have team members who have joined straight out of colleges and engineers who…","Waybridge is a well-funded startup using technology and data science to create efficiencies in the multi-trillion-dollar industry of trading and logistics of physical commodities. We are currently a team comprising technology experts who have revolutionized the ad-tech industry, commodity experts with years of experience in various commodities, and award-winning designers and product managers. We are based in New York, London, and remote.
What problem are you trying to solve?
Think about how easy it is for you to purchase something online: you can see various options, filter by different features, and then once ordered, track where your delivery is until it arrives at your doorstep.
It might surprise you that such systems do not yet exist for manufacturers or suppliers looking to buy or sell raw materials, such as aluminum, copper, or cocoa. Thanks to many challenges involved, particularly due to the market's size, such purchases are currently extremely manual, using a combination of emails, phone calls, and text messages to track purchases, sales, and deliveries.

What are you doing?
We are bringing market intelligence and pricing tools to small and big manufacturers and producers of physical commodities.
By providing financing, price discovery, and other facilities, we create a more transparent marketplace and enable companies to trade with new counterparties.
We are improving the logistics and tracking of commodities around the world. This means optimizing delivery routes resulting in a reduction in carbon footprint.

Where are you now? Who is the team?
Waybridge was founded in September 2019 backed with investment from Venrock and Rucker Park. Our platform is now live with major metals companies and we raised additional capital from existing investors and Craft Ventures in May 2021. We are currently a team of roughly 40 individuals with various backgrounds, skills, and seniorities - from graduates upwards. We have tech experts who have built systems that handle millions of transactions per second, commodity experts with 60 years of combined experience in the industry, and award-winning design and product experts who have worked on complex software products for large enterprises.

Our founding team has experience starting businesses in both the commodity and technology spaces and has successfully built companies from the ground up to reach 1000+ employees.
Where are you based? How are you dealing with Covid-19?
Currently, we are all working from home due to Covid-19. However, we expect to go back to our offices in New York and London in the future. The New York office will most likely be in the greater Flatiron District in Manhattan, and The London office will be located in Central London. This posting is for candidates who are expected to join us in the office; however, we are open to full-time remote. We fully support our team's right to keep themselves and their families safe, so you will only be expected to go back to the office when you feel safe. We will always maintain a flexible work from home policy.

Would I fit in?
We will try our best to make sure you feel at home at Waybridge. Our co-founders genuinely believe that a diverse team will set us up for success. As such, we are working hard to attract diverse candidates who can add value right from the start and grow and thrive further in Waybridge.
We are currently a team composed of different nationalities, genders, and races. A lot of the team has children, and we want Waybridge to be super family-friendly. We will help you handle the challenges that come with having a family. You can talk to us to find out more, and we can put you in touch with relevant team members if you'd like to speak to someone directly.

Do I need Commodity experience?
No, and you don't even need to care that much about commodities to find this space fascinating. Our team includes former commodities quants, logistics, and traders who will quickly get you up to speed. We have regular ""learn and teach"" presentations where we teach each other about various topics, and we share lots of information on our internal wiki.

OK, I am excited; what are you actually after?
In short, we are looking for individuals who are excited to tackle the problems we described above.
You will be working with our CTO, Engineering Leads, and the rest of the technology team to design and build the core product, infrastructure, and tools to meet the needs of a complex business. You'll also be working with Product and Design in a highly collaborative and transparent environment.
You should be excited to solve interesting engineering problems, help establish well-designed engineering processes, and ship high-quality, enterprise-level products. Given where we are now, you will be able to start building and contributing from day one and helping to improve our architecture and practices.

What is your technology stack?
Python, Django, GraphQL, and Postgres.
React, Relay, and Typescript.
AWS, Kubernetes, Docker, Terraform.
Automated CI/CD with staging and production environments.
How senior is the role? What experience do I need?
If you can think you can contribute, you should apply, and we will compensate you based on your experience and ability. We have team members who have joined straight out of colleges and engineers who have joined with 7 year + experience. Ideally, you will hve some of the following experiences, but please do not be put off if you don't tick off all the boxes:
You love building complex products that solve real customer problems.
You are comfortable working with some ambiguity and value incremental progress.
You have had some experience working with non-engineering stakeholders.
You have some experience with some of the tools in our stack (or with similar tools).
What is your interview process?
Right now, our interviews are entirely remote. We try to be flexible with our schedule for calls and quickly get you through the process.
An initial call to meet one of our engineers. We'll tell you a bit about us and learn about your background and what you're looking to do. We may ask short technical questions.
A take-home technical exercise. We understand you will have other commitments, so we will give you enough time to develop a solution you are happy with. Most candidates write in python, but you can choose any language.
A follow-up call to discuss your code submission, with one or two engineers.
Finally, you will meet a few other team members. These will mostly be general chats, but they could quickly get into fun technical discussions if you meet an engineer.
As part of this final round, you will meet some the co-founders to learn more about their background and the business.
What information should I provide in my application?
We love a good story, so it will help us if you tell us a little bit about yourself. Why this position is interesting to you, what you would add to the team, or anything else you think we should know.
Tell me one more time why Waybridge is great?
We are handling real material that is used by almost all of us daily. We think that's cool. We also bring together the physical and digital world.
We help our customers optimize their workflow, reduce cost, increase efficiencies, and improve their carbon footprint.
We are a start-up with a start-up culture. We will move and build things quickly, and every team member will have a real impact on where we go and what we create. But we are well-funded, so we pay market rates.
You get to work with our founding team with a proven track record.

We are currently a team comprising technology experts who have revolutionized the ad-tech industry, commodity experts with years of experience in various commodities, and award-winning designers and product managers. We are based in New York, London, and remote.
What problem are you trying to solve?
Think about how easy it is for you to purchase something online: you can see various options, filter by different features, and then once ordered, track where your delivery is until it arrives at your doorstep.
It might surprise you that such systems do not yet exist for manufacturers or suppliers looking to buy or sell raw materials, such as aluminum, copper, or cocoa. Thanks to many challenges involved, particularly due to the market's size, such purchases are currently extremely manual, using a combination of emails, phone calls, and text messages to track purchases, sales, and deliveries.

What are you doing?
We are bringing market intelligence and pricing tools to small and big manufacturers and producers of physical commodities.
By providing financing, price discovery, and other facilities, we create a more transparent marketplace and enable companies to trade with new counterparties.
We are improving the logistics and tracking of commodities around the world. This means optimizing delivery routes resulting in a reduction in carbon footprint.

Where are you now? Who is the team?
Waybridge was founded in September 2019 backed with investment from Venrock and Rucker Park. Our platform is now live with major metals companies and we raised additional capital from existing investors and Craft Ventures in May 2021. We are currently a team of roughly 40 individuals with various backgrounds, skills, and seniorities - from graduates upwards. We have tech experts who have built systems that handle millions of transactions per second, commodity experts with 60 years of combined experience in the industry, and award-winning design and product experts who have worked on complex software products for large enterprises.

Our founding team has experience starting businesses in both the commodity and technology spaces and has successfully built companies from the ground up to reach 1000+ employees.
Where are you based? How are you dealing with Covid-19?
Currently, we are all working from home due to Covid-19. However, we expect to go back to our offices in New York and London in the future. The New York office will most likely be in the greater Flatiron District in Manhattan, and The London office will be located in Central London. This posting is for candidates who are expected to join us in the office; however, we are open to full-time remote. We fully support our team's right to keep themselves and their families safe, so you will only be expected to go back to the office when you feel safe. We will always maintain a flexible work from home policy.

Would I fit in?
We will try our best to make sure you feel at home at Waybridge. Our co-founders genuinely believe that a diverse team will set us up for success. As such, we are working hard to attract diverse candidates who can add value right from the start and grow and thrive further in Waybridge.
We are currently a team composed of different nationalities, genders, and races. A lot of the team has children, and we want Waybridge to be super family-friendly. We will help you handle the challenges that come with having a family. You can talk to us to find out more, and we can put you in touch with relevant team members if you'd like to speak to someone directly.

Do I need Commodity experience?
No, and you don't even need to care that much about commodities to find this space fascinating. Our team includes former commodities quants, logistics, and traders who will quickly get you up to speed. We have regular ""learn and teach"" presentations where we teach each other about various topics, and we share lots of information on our internal wiki.

OK, I am excited; what are you actually after?
In short, we are looking for individuals who are excited to tackle the problems we described above.
You will be working with our CTO, Engineering Leads, and the rest of the technology team to design and build the core product, infrastructure, and tools to meet the needs of a complex business. You'll also be working with Product and Design in a highly collaborative and transparent environment.
You should be excited to solve interesting engineering problems, help establish well-designed engineering processes, and ship high-quality, enterprise-level products. Given where we are now, you will be able to start building and contributing from day one and helping to improve our architecture and practices.

What is your technology stack?
Python, Django, GraphQL, and Postgres.
React, Relay, and Typescript.
AWS, Kubernetes, Docker, Terraform.
Automated CI/CD with staging and production environments.
How senior is the role? What experience do I need?
If you can think you can contribute, you should apply, and we will compensate you based on your experience and ability. We have team members who have joined straight out of colleges and engineers who have joined with 7 year + experience. Ideally, you will hve some of the following experiences, but please do not be put off if you don't tick off all the boxes:
You love building complex products that solve real customer problems.
You are comfortable working with some ambiguity and value incremental progress.
You have had some experience working with non-engineering stakeholders.
You have some experience with some of the tools in our stack (or with similar tools).
What is your interview process?
Right now, our interviews are entirely remote. We try to be flexible with our schedule for calls and quickly get you through the process.
An initial call to meet one of our engineers. We'll tell you a bit about us and learn about your background and what you're looking to do. We may ask short technical questions.
A take-home technical exercise. We understand you will have other commitments, so we will give you enough time to develop a solution you are happy with. Most candidates write in python, but you can choose any language.
A follow-up call to discuss your code submission, with one or two engineers.
Finally, you will meet a few other team members. These will mostly be general chats, but they could quickly get into fun technical discussions if you meet an engineer.
As part of this final round, you will meet some the co-founders to learn more about their background and the business.
What information should I provide in my application?
We love a good story, so it will help us if you tell us a little bit about yourself. Why this position is interesting to you, what you would add to the team, or anything else you think we should know.
Tell me one more time why Waybridge is great?
We are handling real material that is used by almost all of us daily. We think that's cool. We also bring together the physical and digital world.
We help our customers optimize their workflow, reduce cost, increase efficiencies, and improve their carbon footprint.
We are a start-up with a start-up culture. We will move and build things quickly, and every team member will have a real impact on where we go and what we create. But we are well-funded, so we pay market rates.
You get to work with our founding team with a proven track record.

That's why our mission is to build the world's most powerful network of sports video and data to empower teams to make every moment count.
How? By hiring people around the world who want to help us support coaches, players, analysts, recruiters, teams, clubs and fans. Hudl customers use our products to capture video, analyze data, share highlights and a lot more. They stay ahead of the game with the latest technology and we help them achieve their goals.
Want to join us?
You will be joining one of our cross-functional product teams in London, working predominantly on performance analysis tools (e.g. Hudl Sportscode) used by elite teams around the world (e.g. Premier League, Bundesliga, NBA, AFL, etc.).
Ideally, you are an independent thinker and self-starter, and this role suits someone that has a passion for developing products that provide the competitive edge, improve user flows, and save people valuable time. You will be predominantly working with C# (.NET backend), Swift (native Mac app development), React and Typescript, but don't worry if you're not familiar with some or any of these, as long as you are keen to learn, we definitely want to hear from you.
You Are
Curious. Motivated to explore the unknown because it's the unknown. You don't hesitate to pick up a new language or framework when it's the best tool for the job because you can master it as needed.
Passionate. You have a passion translating real-world problems into elegant code solutions, take pride in your side projects, or the impact your work is having.
Pragmatic. Understand the balancing act between crafting a robust, lasting solution and getting work done.
Team-oriented. Understand that problem solving is a team effort and will help others in our Engineering Team learn and develop their skills.
User-focused. Excited to have your work used by real people to solve real problems.
Willing to learn. You have solid engineering skills but are always willing to dive into specific areas to gain the expertise needed to be successful in your role.
You Will
Extend and maintain Hudl's elite products. You will play a key role in the development and maintenance of Hudl's products for the elite sports market.
Deliver great user value. You will work on products that are critical to our elite teams' analysis flows, likely making the difference between a loss and a win in a game.
Be a cross-functional member of your team. You will work with other team members to plan, develop, test, and ship the work you do.
Be an involved team member. You will actively participate in scrum ceremonies and proactively and thoughtfully create tickets for the team's backlog.
We Will
Celebrate work at Hudl retreats. We like to gather our Hudlies from around the world to showcase achievements and strategize for the future.
Treat you like an adult. We're all about a healthy work-life balance. We'll give you unlimited vacation time and have company-wide timeout days (no meetings allowed).
Provide career growth. We're lifelong learners who encourage professional development. We'll give you tons of resources and opportunities to keep growing.
Supply you with tools for success. We've invested in our office spaces, designing them with our employees in mind. You'll have the enriching, flexible environment and powerful hardware you need to do your job well.
Support your mental health. We care about our employees' wellbeing. Our Employee Assistance Program and Employee Resource Groups have you covered.

Broadway is seeking Senior Software Engineers to develop state-of-the-art C++ applications for our groundbreaking automated trading platform. We are a rapidly growing international enterprise software company built and run by engineers. Our technology makes it simple to create, combine, and extend large-scale, high-performance intelligent systems in ways that were never before possible.

Broadway’s solutions are built on the TOC, our core platform for scalable high-performance distributed computing. For over a decade, we’ve been using the TOC to build intelligent trading systems for leading financial institutions. We’re now starting to leverage the same technology to solve real-time problems across every industry.

You will own (typically multiple months-long) development projects end-to-end at the forefront of one of the most exciting areas in fintech, from conception through support and maintenance, including many fast-cycle version iterations. As part of our remarkably high-performing team of collaborative, talented engineers who thrive on building the most advanced technology, you will have significant freedom and self-direction to tackle a wealth of interesting, challenging problems as we push the technological envelope.

Culture
We’re not just engineering systems, we’re engineering a company. Preserving our culture is the most important thing to us as we scale. It’s the way we come together to find the best solutions, and how we hold ourselves accountable to achieving our vision: delivering success for our customers and meaningful experiences for our people.

Do Something Big: The future promises a lot—the Internet of Everything, smart connected cities, transparent markets, virtual medicine—but these advances require more than what's possible with conventional solutions. We’ve developed a new way to build distributed systems. For over a decade, we’ve used it to build complex trading systems for the world’s largest financial institutions, and now we’re starting to solve real-time problems across every industry.

Blaze Your Own Trail: We’re at an exciting stage—small but growing fast. There are unprecedented opportunities to learn and lead right away. Whatever your goals, from heads-down development to collaborating with customers, from executing and streamlining our business to leading teams, from innovating new products to opening up new industries, or a bit of “all of the above"", we’ll work together to get you there. There is no one path. You’ll have the freedom to follow your interests as they evolve.

Solve Hard Problems: The engineering we do is complex—thousands of globally distributed components, vast amounts of fast-moving shared data, continuous real-time analysis and execution, always-on mission-critical performance. It ordinarily takes years to solve these problems (think aerospace or flight control) but that’s not an option for us. Our fintech executes hundreds of billions of dollars in trades each day, so there’s huge value in launching ideas fast. We invent smarter designs and smarter ways to develop and test, so we can innovate in quick cycles without compromising the exacting requirements inherent to the systems we build.

Be Greater Together: We tackle problems no one could solve alone, so we’re here to learn from each other. Each insight is a springboard for the next. We encourage disagreement to achieve a greater outcome. But solving hard problems is only part of the equation—we hire people who inspire us and enjoy working together. The result is a team that truly “clicks”.

Do the Right Thing: Building a healthy, lasting company starts from the inside out. Our progressive policies and practices foster transparency, integrity, openness, and forward thinking. We are deeply committed to building a company that empowers people, enables them to thrive throughout their careers, and do big things here.

HR Director, Victoria James • 02 September 2021
We are looking for Frontend Software Engineers to come and help us deliver award-winning work for some great clients including the Royal Navy, Honda, Orange, Versus Arthritis and more.
We’ve got loads of interesting work coming up, including greenfield cutting-edge front end tech projects – we’re really excited about it, and if you’re a frontend engineer looking for a new challenge, this could be for you!
The work
The team are actively using exciting frontend tech, including the likes of:
Jamstack
React
Gatsby
XState
Headless CMS
Web animations
Here are some examples of the kind of things we’ve built in the team:
A completely greenfield progressive web app to revolutionise how Royal Navy personnel get information and get things done - built with Gatsby.js & React, GraphQL and a headless CMS
A secure ship-to-ship, ultra-low bandwidth communications system for the Royal Navy - built with Web Socket technology and REST APIs
An MVP Arabic website for Aston Villa FC – built with Gatsby.js & React
A multi-region online motorbike configurator engine for Honda – built with React & XState
We’ve also got plans in terms of deploying tech like WebGL and we keep an eye on any new, relevant technology that comes along. You will have the opportunity to keep learning, stay on top of new trends, and build interesting things in a fast-paced environment alongside very smart colleagues and a lovely client.
Required skills
You will need to be a great frontend engineer, and we’d expect you to be leading by example when it comes to software engineering best practice. We’re looking for someone who can lead a project from a frontend perspective and influence both other members of the engineering team, the wider experience team and our clients to make sure we’re delivering scalable, high-quality solutions.
You’ll need:
Experience with modern front-end tech including SPA frameworks and API integration
To be a fast learner
To be both a creative and logical thinker
To be passionate about the quality of the end product
To have an enthusiastic, positive, calm and professional approach
To be proactive and show initiative
To have good awareness of industry trends, best practices and standards
To be able to adapt at the pace of an agency
To have excellent time management skills
Some of the tech we’ve mentioned is quite specific – XState for example. If you don’t have experience with some of them, don’t let that put you off applying – but we would expect you to have looked up anything you’ve not heard of before an interview so we can get your take on it.
Interview process
Very straightforward. And friendly. Not designed to catch you out – very much designed to make sure you’re the right fit for us and we’re the right fit for you.
We’ll have an initial chat to make sure you’ve got all the information you need on the role, and on Great State generally, and to answer any questions you might have. We’ll ask you to talk through your (relevant) experience briefly – but no tricky questions.


The second stage is a more detailed run-through of your experience with a couple of members of our software engineering team. We don’t plan out a list of questions in advance, we’ll see where the conversation takes us. Be prepared to talk through what you’ve done and how you did it. And feel free to ask more questions of us (we like people who ask questions).
The third stage is a technical exercise, tailored to the role and your experience. It’s designed to not take up too much of your free time, but it’s important that we can see how you approach problems from a technical point of view. We might ask you to talk us through how you did it in more detail, we might not.

That’s it. Three stages, some interesting conversations, and then with any luck – a job offer and high fives all round.
Benefits
We offer all the usual fun benefits associated with a digital agency plus flexible working hours, the ability to work from home and 27 days holiday, plus bank holidays."

We insure small businesses and enable big dreams – not just for our customers, but for our people and communities too. With over 750,000 active insurance policies, we protect builders, bakers, landlords, and more than 1,000 other trades.

We’re a B Corp too, which recognises our strong track record of having a positive impact on people, society and the environment.

But what’s it like to work here? Here are three reasons why Simply Business could be your next employer

We Embrace Individuality We value what’s important to each and every SBer. Whether that be providing access to cutting edge wellbeing support, or being part of one of our many diversity networks and communities. We also take personal development seriously - we’re all about enabling big dreams.

We Trust Who We Hire We empower SBers with choice and flexibility to make the right decisions based on the needs of their roles and we’ve been working this way long before Covid19.
There’s no one-size-fits all solution when it comes to how often we get together in person, so all of our people and teams find the rhythm that suits them best when it comes to working from home or hub.
We’re innovative We've created a place for people to be curious, experience new things, and bring unique ideas to the table. If you want to learn how we do all this - head over to our Careers page where you’ll see us walk the talk

the potential to earn an annual bonus based on business performance (those on commission-led roles will be rewarded monthly)

Help grow the product & engineering team by interviewing candidates, onboarding new hires and…","Send your resume to jobs@lindushealth.com to apply. (Holiday note: We usually respond within 24 hours but are taking a break at the end of December 2021. Expect a response in early January.)
Lindus Health is looking for a Principal Software Engineer to build the platform powering the next generation of clinical trials. We want to add a very experienced engineer to our small team to do hands-on product development, drive long-term architecture and evolve our engineering practices as the team grows.
About us
Clinical trials are in crisis. The industry hasn't changed in 30 years, and the cost of bringing new medicines to market is skyrocketing as a result.
Lindus Health’s mission is to fix this. We accelerate clinical trials, so patients can benefit. We’re building the world’s first full stack clinical trial platform, to conduct faster, safer clinical trials on behalf of companies developing new treatments, and lowering the barriers to participation for patients.
Since launching the company in March 2021 we have helped find over 5,000 patients for more than 25 clinical trials in areas like type 2 diabetes, COVID-19 diagnostics and mental health. We closed a $5m seed round to grow our platform and team.

About you
You have at least 7 years of experience as a software engineer. This includes at least 1 year in a role that could be characterized as “senior+” - a role where you acted as a tech lead for a project with multiple engineers or where you demonstrated impact across multiple teams or functions.
You are comfortable working across a stack that includes frontend (TypeScript/React), backend (Python/Django/Postgres) and infrastructure (AWS). You don’t necessarily have hands-on experience with all pieces of our stack but are happy to pick up technology that’s new to you.
You are product-minded: you want to understand why we are building something to figure out the best how in collaboration with product managers, trial managers and users. You like to iterate on features based on user feedback.
You are an excellent listener and communicator who can build consensus, drive decisions and resolve conflicts. You write clearly and know when to deploy written artifacts to move teams and projects along.
You like an early-stage startup environment where you have lots of autonomy and opportunities to grow your skills. You want to have a major impact on architecture and engineering practices as we grow from a small team to a large organization.
You belong here! If your experience and interests match with some of the above, we want you to apply.
Why join the Lindus Health team?
Be part of the founding team on a mission to change the way healthcare operates!
£80K - 95K base salary, plus 0.3 - 0.5% equity in stock options
Unlimited holidays; everyone is encouraged to take at least 28 days off each year
Flexible office arrangement; come into the office in London as often as you like, or work remotely within the UK
If working mostly remotely: regular all-expenses paid trips to London to see the whole team (pandemic permitting)
Monthly team events and days out, recently we've been to Legoland, and a Millwall FC home game (decided by popular vote)
Up to £500 towards setting up your home office
A new laptop as your main workstation
UK visa sponsorship if you’re not already eligible to work in the UK
What you will do
In your first month:
Learn about clinical trials and the problems we are trying to solve from our co-founders, medical lead and trial managers
Get your development environment set up, figure out a starter project with the team, make your first commits and your first deploys
Start participating in the regular product development cycle with the product & engineering team
Within your first year:
Collaborate with our trial partners and users to iterate on features they are using as well as to discover and ship new features
Take on technical leadership for a major product area and work with co-founders & product managers to set the product direction
Facilitate long-term architecture and design decisions with the whole engineering team
Evolve engineering practices and work on making the team more productive in areas such as testing, CI, deployment pipelines, cloud infrastructure
Help grow the product & engineering team by interviewing candidates, onboarding new hires and mentoring other engineers
Our technology strategy
Collaboration rocks. We like processes that emphasize openness and knowledge sharing across disciplines, across hierarchies and across time. We acknowledge that sharing, discussing and documenting their work means a certain amount of overhead for individuals, but this is more than offset in the long run by a culture of healthy teams and individual growth.
Iterate with abandon. We recognize that we often don’t know what the heck we’re doing when we start working on a new feature or technical problem, but we know that our understanding will improve as we start down a path to a particular solution. We favor tools and processes that support rapid iteration and frequent validation through user feedback and metrics.
Favor boring technology. We choose languages, frameworks, libraries, architectures and tools that are well-established in order to focus on the part that's hard and exciting and accelerates clinical trials the most: product development. We like a mature technology that has been around for at least a decade with abundant documentation and a large community around it. We deviate from this norm in targeted areas of innovation relevant to the business.
Related reading: Boring Technology (Dan McKinley), Buy vs build (Camille Fournier)
Test in production. We recognize that the last steps of integration and productionization of a new feature are hard - often harder than writing the code in the first place. We favor tools and processes that let us deploy to production early and often and as confidently as possible. We believe that deep insight into how their code behaves with real data and real users is crucial for engineers to get better at their craft.

Our hiring process for engineers
Send your resume to jobs@lindushealth.com. We welcome all applicants regardless of gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, religion, civil or family status, age, disability, or race. If Lindus Health’s mission resonates with you, we want you to apply! We commit to responding to you within 24 hours (weekends and holidays excepted).
Initial call with a co-founder (30 minutes): This is your opportunity to learn more about Lindus Health. We want to tell you about our mission and what we're doing to revolutionise health research.
Technical discussion with Nik, our CTO and a co-founder (90 minutes): This is a session in two parts where we figure out whether your technical skills mesh with our team. We deliberately don’t demand you write code or solve algorithm puzzles in real time, though you have the option to do a coding challenge at your own pace if you like.
Part 1: Code. You can choose between talking about a piece of code you’ve already written or complete a coding challenge at home that we then talk about. In the first option, you share a piece of your code that you think is interesting. We will walk through the code together and discuss your thought process, challenges you’ve faced and potential refactorings. If you choose the second option you get instructions for a coding challenge that you can do at your own pace ahead of the discussion. The challenge is designed to take no more than 2 hours to complete.
Part 2: Architecture & practices. We will share a document with you in advance that explains our team’s current architecture choices and practices. We will discuss what appeals to you about it, what you would change and what you would add to it. As a principal you would be expected to help evolve our architecture and practices.
Systems design & writing assignment (up to 2 hours): We will ask you to write a design document for a system given some basic requirements. You do this at your own pace at home.
Values interview (45 minutes): This is a conversation with 1 or 2 co-founders about our values and culture and also your chance to ask any questions you still have about Lindus Health.
Meeting the team (one or two calls of 30 mins, or an in-person meeting if you’re in London): At this stage you’ll want to get to know more of the people you’ll be working with. We’ll set up informal calls or meet you in person at our office near Victoria station in London.
Offer! If you've come this far, receive an offer and join the team to help us bring about the next generation of healthcare research. We move fast and usually make a decision within hours of your last meeting."

We insure small businesses and enable big dreams – not just for our customers, but for our people and communities too. With over 750,000 active insurance policies, we protect builders, bakers, landlords, and more than 1,000 other trades.

We’re a B Corp too, which recognises our strong track record of having a positive impact on people, society and the environment.

But what’s it like to work here? Here are three reasons why Simply Business could be your next employer

We Embrace Individuality We value what’s important to each and every SBer. Whether that be providing access to cutting edge wellbeing support, or being part of one of our many diversity networks and communities. We also take personal development seriously - we’re all about enabling big dreams.

We Trust Who We Hire We empower SBers with choice and flexibility to make the right decisions based on the needs of their roles and we’ve been working this way long before Covid19.
There’s no one-size-fits all solution when it comes to how often we get together in person, so all of our people and teams find the rhythm that suits them best when it comes to working from home or hub.
We’re innovative We've created a place for people to be curious, experience new things, and bring unique ideas to the table. If you want to learn how we do all this - head over to our Careers page where you’ll see us walk the talk

We need a Software Engineer to join us in London

Our Tech Stack: Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Scala, MongoDB, Spark, AWS, Docker, Kafka, Terraform, JavaScript, SCSS, React, Webpack
As a Software Engineer you’ll:
develop customer-focused products in a culture that champions Agile, cross functional teams and continuous collaboration
Responsibilities include:
being hands-on in developing our products using best practices, appropriate tools and technologies
working with cross functional collaborative teams, helping to clarify requirements at the onset of projects and suggesting different and relevant technical approaches
championing Agile processes whilst creating amazingly useful systems in a collaborative way for our customers
highlighting areas for continuous improvement and driving their prioritisation
being proactive in suggesting new tools, technologies and ways of working.
What we’re looking for:
strong programming skills in any language. We look for strong Engineers and our philosophy is that a strong Engineer is not defined by the technologies they use; therefore Ruby experience is not essential. You’ll just need to be happy to cross-over to Ruby if you join us – and we will support you with that
the ability to communicate complex technical concepts to both tech and non-tech colleagues
understanding and appreciation of Agile methodologies
strong desire to work collaboratively with business teams. We do not divide ‘business’ and tech’ teams, we see both as one team as we are all working towards one shared goal
strong interpersonal skills to work well in our very open and friendly environment
pro-active in suggesting new tools, processes and technologies – anything which will help us continually improve!
Our culture is inclusive and diverse

Our mission is to make Simply Business synonymous with fairness, belonging and inclusivity. We won’t be happy until we’ve created a truly inclusive culture – where every employee, whatever their background, role, or location, feels comfortable being their authentic self at work.

We all have a part to play – to learn more, to do more and to go further – in building this new reality that’ll be befitting of the diversity of the customers we serve. At Simply Business, we’re all in.

What are the benefits?

At Simply Business, our benefits let you balance life and work properly:

flexible parental leave – you can choose to take shared parental leave, plus we offer full pay for the first six months of your maternity leave and four-week fully paid paternity leave, subject to meeting the qualifying criteria
remote working – more of us are currently working remotely than usual, but longer-term you can balance working remotely with working in the office, giving you the opportunity to connect with colleagues
mental health and wellbeing resources – we take your wellbeing seriously, giving you access to counselling (through our Employee Assistance Programme) as well as technology to support your mental health (through the Unmind app)
paid sabbatical – two weeks off when you’ve been here for five years and four weeks off when you’ve been here for 10 years
a dedicated learning platform – including a management and leadership programme – the platform lets you balance both work and life goals

And we compensate you fairly:

a competitive salary that reflects your experience, our pay policy and the market we’re in from your first day
the potential to earn an annual bonus based on business performance (those on commission-led roles will be rewarded monthly)
we match what you put into your pension up to five per cent

life assurance of four times of your basic salary
Smart Health services including unlimited access to a 24/7 virtual GP
a flexible benefits scheme with an allocated allowance each year to choose from benefits including private medical insurance, dental insurance, travel insurance, up to five days extra holiday, and gym membership

Help grow the product & engineering team by interviewing candidates, onboarding new hires and…","Send your resume to jobs@lindushealth.com to apply. (Holiday note: We usually respond within 24 hours but are taking a break at the end of December 2021. Expect a response in early January.)
Lindus Health is looking for a Principal Software Engineer to build the platform powering the next generation of clinical trials. We want to add a very experienced engineer to our small team to do hands-on product development, drive long-term architecture and evolve our engineering practices as the team grows.
About us
Clinical trials are in crisis. The industry hasn't changed in 30 years, and the cost of bringing new medicines to market is skyrocketing as a result.
Lindus Health’s mission is to fix this. We accelerate clinical trials, so patients can benefit. We’re building the world’s first full stack clinical trial platform, to conduct faster, safer clinical trials on behalf of companies developing new treatments, and lowering the barriers to participation for patients.
Since launching the company in March 2021 we have helped find over 5,000 patients for more than 25 clinical trials in areas like type 2 diabetes, COVID-19 diagnostics and mental health. We closed a $5m seed round to grow our platform and team.

About you
You have at least 7 years of experience as a software engineer. This includes at least 1 year in a role that could be characterized as “senior+” - a role where you acted as a tech lead for a project with multiple engineers or where you demonstrated impact across multiple teams or functions.
You are comfortable working across a stack that includes frontend (TypeScript/React), backend (Python/Django/Postgres) and infrastructure (AWS). You don’t necessarily have hands-on experience with all pieces of our stack but are happy to pick up technology that’s new to you.
You are product-minded: you want to understand why we are building something to figure out the best how in collaboration with product managers, trial managers and users. You like to iterate on features based on user feedback.
You are an excellent listener and communicator who can build consensus, drive decisions and resolve conflicts. You write clearly and know when to deploy written artifacts to move teams and projects along.
You like an early-stage startup environment where you have lots of autonomy and opportunities to grow your skills. You want to have a major impact on architecture and engineering practices as we grow from a small team to a large organization.
You belong here! If your experience and interests match with some of the above, we want you to apply.
Why join the Lindus Health team?
Be part of the founding team on a mission to change the way healthcare operates!
£80K - 95K base salary, plus 0.3 - 0.5% equity in stock options
Unlimited holidays; everyone is encouraged to take at least 28 days off each year
Flexible office arrangement; come into the office in London as often as you like, or work remotely within the UK
If working mostly remotely: regular all-expenses paid trips to London to see the whole team (pandemic permitting)
Monthly team events and days out, recently we've been to Legoland, and a Millwall FC home game (decided by popular vote)
Up to £500 towards setting up your home office
A new laptop as your main workstation
UK visa sponsorship if you’re not already eligible to work in the UK
What you will do
In your first month:
Learn about clinical trials and the problems we are trying to solve from our co-founders, medical lead and trial managers
Get your development environment set up, figure out a starter project with the team, make your first commits and your first deploys
Start participating in the regular product development cycle with the product & engineering team
Within your first year:
Collaborate with our trial partners and users to iterate on features they are using as well as to discover and ship new features
Take on technical leadership for a major product area and work with co-founders & product managers to set the product direction
Facilitate long-term architecture and design decisions with the whole engineering team
Evolve engineering practices and work on making the team more productive in areas such as testing, CI, deployment pipelines, cloud infrastructure
Help grow the product & engineering team by interviewing candidates, onboarding new hires and mentoring other engineers
Our technology strategy
Collaboration rocks. We like processes that emphasize openness and knowledge sharing across disciplines, across hierarchies and across time. We acknowledge that sharing, discussing and documenting their work means a certain amount of overhead for individuals, but this is more than offset in the long run by a culture of healthy teams and individual growth.
Iterate with abandon. We recognize that we often don’t know what the heck we’re doing when we start working on a new feature or technical problem, but we know that our understanding will improve as we start down a path to a particular solution. We favor tools and processes that support rapid iteration and frequent validation through user feedback and metrics.
Favor boring technology. We choose languages, frameworks, libraries, architectures and tools that are well-established in order to focus on the part that's hard and exciting and accelerates clinical trials the most: product development. We like a mature technology that has been around for at least a decade with abundant documentation and a large community around it. We deviate from this norm in targeted areas of innovation relevant to the business.
Related reading: Boring Technology (Dan McKinley), Buy vs build (Camille Fournier)
Test in production. We recognize that the last steps of integration and productionization of a new feature are hard - often harder than writing the code in the first place. We favor tools and processes that let us deploy to production early and often and as confidently as possible. We believe that deep insight into how their code behaves with real data and real users is crucial for engineers to get better at their craft.

Our hiring process for engineers
Send your resume to jobs@lindushealth.com. We welcome all applicants regardless of gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, religion, civil or family status, age, disability, or race. If Lindus Health’s mission resonates with you, we want you to apply! We commit to responding to you within 24 hours (weekends and holidays excepted).
Initial call with a co-founder (30 minutes): This is your opportunity to learn more about Lindus Health. We want to tell you about our mission and what we're doing to revolutionise health research.
Technical discussion with Nik, our CTO and a co-founder (90 minutes): This is a session in two parts where we figure out whether your technical skills mesh with our team. We deliberately don’t demand you write code or solve algorithm puzzles in real time, though you have the option to do a coding challenge at your own pace if you like.
Part 1: Code. You can choose between talking about a piece of code you’ve already written or complete a coding challenge at home that we then talk about. In the first option, you share a piece of your code that you think is interesting. We will walk through the code together and discuss your thought process, challenges you’ve faced and potential refactorings. If you choose the second option you get instructions for a coding challenge that you can do at your own pace ahead of the discussion. The challenge is designed to take no more than 2 hours to complete.
Part 2: Architecture & practices. We will share a document with you in advance that explains our team’s current architecture choices and practices. We will discuss what appeals to you about it, what you would change and what you would add to it. As a principal you would be expected to help evolve our architecture and practices.
Systems design & writing assignment (up to 2 hours): We will ask you to write a design document for a system given some basic requirements. You do this at your own pace at home.
Values interview (45 minutes): This is a conversation with 1 or 2 co-founders about our values and culture and also your chance to ask any questions you still have about Lindus Health.
Meeting the team (one or two calls of 30 mins, or an in-person meeting if you’re in London): At this stage you’ll want to get to know more of the people you’ll be working with. We’ll set up informal calls or meet you in person at our office near Victoria station in London.
Offer! If you've come this far, receive an offer and join the team to help us bring about the next generation of healthcare research. We move fast and usually make a decision within hours of your last meeting."
