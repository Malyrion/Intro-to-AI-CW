Kafka for our asynchronous message queue.
React for internal web dashboards.","At Monzo we're aiming to build the best current account in the world. We are always keen to hear from capable, creative engineers who want to help us accomplish that goal
Our backend engineers have a variety of different backgrounds
We have several non-graduates; only some of us studied Computer Science; one of the team has a degree in Marketing; some of us have worked in huge companies; some have only ever worked in startups; others are former consultants. As long as you enjoy learning new things, we'd love to talk to you. We do not ask for formal qualifications or degree requirements for any of our engineering roles.
We are actively creating an equitable environment for all of our engineers to thrive
Diversity and inclusion are a priority for us and we are making sure we have lots of support for all of our people to grow at Monzo. We provide a sponsorship framework in Engineering for women and people of colour; all of our leaders are trained on privilege awareness and we are creating partnerships with organisations dedicated to supporting underrepresented groups. You can read more in our 2020 Diversity and Inclusion report.
We encourage an open and transparent working environment
You can get involved in any aspect of the business you are interested in and, following Stripe's example, all emails in the company are visible in an email archive. We contribute to open source software as much as possible. Our blog is a good place to learn even more about what we do!
Monzo works in project-based sprints in small, interdisciplinary teams
We have around 150 engineers out of roughly 1,400 people in total - and we have big ambitions. There are many interesting challenges ahead, and we're happy for people to move between teams or to specialise, whatever you prefer. As an engineer here you'd be able to work directly with anyone across the company, and we run regular knowledge-sharing sessions so you'll learn heaps about everything from how banks work to effective communication.
At Monzo you will get to work with a lot of exciting new technology.
We rely heavily on the following tools and technologies:
Go to write our application code (there's an excellent interactive Go tutorial here)
Cassandra for most persistent data storage
Kafka for our asynchronous message queue
Envoy Proxy for RPC
Kubernetes and Docker to schedule and run our services (Oliver, our VP Architecture, gave a great talk at KubeCon on how we use these technologies)
AWS for most of our infrastructure
React for internal web dashboards
We also have two physical datacenter sites with actual cables to connect to various third parties
Our product squads are truly cross-functional.
This role is all about collaborating across disciplines to test hypotheses and make a difference to customers. As a product backend engineer you'll work in a squad alongside product managers, marketers, user researchers, designers, mobile engineers, web engineers, data analysts, business analysts, writers and more!
Together you'll build and support a particular part of Monzo. Our product squads belong to one of four collectives (a word we use to describe self-governing business units of ~100 people). They are: Growth & Core, Borrowing, Operations and Money. They're all looking for additional Backend Engineers right now.
The Growth & Core collective helps people to discover Monzo and make the most of it.
Growth & Core is a collective focused on different aspects of our mission to 'make money work for everyone' and it has four squads. They make users effortlessly financially savvy with features like Budgeting, Pots and the Salary Sorter. Many of the customer problems they solve are revenue opportunities, too – like Monzo Plus, Business Banking, and the Savings marketplace. Last year they also launched our Open Banking APIs, shipped a simpler and more future-proof navigation structure, and enabled Monzo customers to get their salary paid a day early for free!
The Borrowing collective makes borrowing money simple, fair and transparent.
We're really proud that this fair approach to lending helps people to get what they want from life on their own terms. Squads in Borrowing have already shipped and scaled overdrafts to hundreds of thousands of Monzo customers. They've made it easy to take out a loan without the unfair fees or confusing pricing that you find elsewhere. They work on everything from the way borrowing works in the app, right down to how they move and account for money that our customers borrow. One of the most interesting problems they face is deciding how much to lend and to whom. The team believes that they can make access to credit fairer and more transparent.
The Operations collective is responsible for our incredible customer support.
The Operations collective looks after one of the most interesting problem spaces at Monzo: as we grow, we want to ensure that we're using technology as effectively as possible whilst still maintaining customer service so good that you want to tell your friends. Our engineers within this area of the business help us to explore these challenges. Central to it all is Monzo Chat – a completely bespoke bit of software we've built from the ground up to manage chats in our app - but we're also doing work with machine learning, and looking at how technology can more broadly support our wonderful support team (we call them COps) in other aspects.
The Money collective helps Monzo move fast and in control with our money
We are the bank within the bank and are responsible for the core infrastructure and banking services you associate with Monzo. We are the Guardians of the Monzo Ledger and own everything related to our distinctive Hot Coral cards.
Engineering squads within the Money collective carry out a variety of payments and finance related work, we built our very own Mastercard processor from scratch and recently we successfully replaced a third-party Faster Payments Gateway with our own internal Gateway to reduce outages we can't control. On top of this we've been ensuring our payment schemes are compliant with key regulatory requirements such as Strong Customer Authentication (SCA), 3D Secure V2 (3DSV2), making sure that our core infrastructure and services will scale to support our ambitious growth plans and that we always know where our money is and can report accurately and reliably on it.
The financial crime at Monzo team focuses on making sure our services are a hostile environment for criminals
We tackle all financial crime together as one team, this includes money laundering, fraud, sanctions breaches, terrorist financing, bribery and corruption and tax evasion. Engineers get to work on core services that are consumed by many different products which means we have a really broad perspective. We've had some major successes in combating financial crime, most famously The Ticketmaster Breach where we spotted large-scale fraudulent activity due to a Ticketmaster data breach before Ticketmaster or other banks did.
The TechOps team
The TechOps team are challenging the traditional IT model by building a brand new people platform to automate all aspects of a Monzo staff member's time here. We're building an industry leading people platform to support our staff in a delightful way and to accommodate rapid growth across multiple countries. This approach will allow us to empower our staff by providing smart, efficient and powerful tools instead of relying on traditional IT systems and a horde of IT staff.
You should apply if
Our open roles are for mid-level to senior Backend Engineers at present.

you have strong experience working on the backend of a technology product
you think you'd enjoy the kind of work we're doing
you want to be involved in building a product that you (and the people you know) use every day
you have a product mindset: you care about customer outcomes and you want to make data-informed decisions
you're comfortable working in a team that deals with ambiguity
you're interested in distributed systems and writing resilient software
you have some experience with strongly-typed languages (Go, Java, C, Scala etc.).
Logistics
Salary is around £90,000 - £116,000 plus stock options and other benefits.
We can help you relocate to London & we can sponsor visas.
This role can be based in our London office, but we're open to distributed working (with ad hoc meetings in London once COVID is over).
We're usually always hiring for Backend Engineers, so there's no closing date for this job.
We offer flexible working hours and trust you to work enough hours to do your job well, at times that suit you and your team.
Diversity and inclusion is a priority for us – if we want to solve problems for people around the world, our team has to represent our customers. So we need to attract the best talent and create an environment that supports and includes them. You can read more about diversity and inclusion on our blog.
If you prefer to work part-time, we'll make this happen whenever we can - whether this is to help you meet other commitments or strike a great work-life balance.
Our interview process is normally a phone interview, a coding task and call to discuss it, and 2-3 hours of onsite interviews that can be conducted via hangouts as well. We promise not to ask you any brain teasers or trick questions. We might design a system together on a whiteboard, the same way we often work together, but we won't make you write code on one.
Equal Opportunity Statement
At Monzo, embracing diversity in all of its forms and fostering an inclusive environment for all people to do the best work of their lives with us. This is integral to our mission of making money work for everyone.
We're an equal opportunity employer. All applicants will be considered for employment without attention to ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, family or parental status, national origin, veteran, neurodiversity status or disability status.

Providing and managing the foundational infrastructure for other Security and Platform Engineering squads to build upon;
Managing our secrets, keys and certificates to ensure our systems are airtight;

Ensuring that our cloud infrastructure and physical data centres are secure;
Building a deep understanding of the security of key technologies such as Vault, Kubernetes, Cassandra, Teleport and AWS and how we can improve them;
Performing threat modelling to mitigate the most important attack vectors against our infrastructure.
Monzo's security team has a wide range of responsibilities. As a bank, we are solving diverse, novel problems to ensure that our customers and their data are secure.
One of the guiding principles of security at Monzo is that security at the expense of user experience is a last resort. We aim to move mountains in the background so that we can build world-class features without compromising on security.
As a Backend Engineer in Security you'd be able to work directly with lots of teams across the company, and we run regular knowledge-sharing sessions so you'll learn heaps about everything; from how banks work to effective communication and the technologies we use.
You should apply if
You have experience in software engineering (we use Go, but we're open to all backgrounds) and you're excited about solving large-scale infrastructure security problems.
You're comfortable securing cloud-based environments and networks, and wrangling with code at this level of abstraction.
You're passionate about security and understand best practices.
You're constantly looking for flaws in systems and can reason about how best to address them.

This role can be based in our London office, but we're open to distributed working.
We have payroll set up in four countries: the UK, Ireland, and France. Right now, we can only hire people who work from those countries and we'll keep this updated with new ones as we expand and are able to hire from more places
We offer flexible working hours and trust you to work enough hours to do your job well, at times that suit you and your team.
Diversity and inclusion is a priority for us – if we want to solve problems for people around the world, our team has to represent our customers. So we need to attract the best talent and create an environment that supports and includes them. You can read more about diversity and inclusion on our blog.
If you prefer to work part-time, we'll make this happen whenever we can - whether this is to help you meet other commitments or strike a great work-life balance.
Our interview process is normally an initial phone interview followed by a take-home task and call to discuss it (or alternatively a paired-programming exercise), if successful you will move to a final round of 3 separate interviews conducted via hangouts. We promise not to ask you any brain teasers or trick questions. We might design a system together on a whiteboard, the same way we often work together, but we won't make you write code on one.
Equal Opportunity Statement
At Monzo, embracing diversity in all of its forms and fostering an inclusive environment for all people to do the best work of their lives with us. This is integral to our mission of making money work for everyone.
We're an equal opportunity employer. All applicants will be considered for employment without attention to ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, family or parental status, national origin, veteran, neurodiversity status or disability status.
What is Monzo about?
We're a bank on a mission to make money work for everyone. By focusing on solving real problems rather than selling financial products, treating people fairly and being totally transparent, we believe we can make banking better.
Monzo started in 2015 with big plans and a little office in Shoreditch, London. Now we're a fully-licensed bank with millions of customers in the UK, and well over a thousand employees around the world.

We are always keen to hear from capable, creative engineers who want to help us accomplish that goal
We're currently looking for Senior Backend Engineers to join our Platform team.
We're looking for engineers with experience working with Platforms who are software engineers at heart - you're as comfortable writing software to solve problems as you are operating AWS or Kubernetes. If you're a software engineer who has some good cloud infrastructure experience already, or you're eager to get really familiar with systems, tooling and libraries, this could be the role for you.
As a team, we're responsible for designing, building, and operating the services we consume from AWS, along with the software we run on top like Kubernetes, Cassandra, Prometheus, and Kafka. We're also responsible for operating our two physical data centres, our network, and being on-call for the things we own and run.
To achieve this, we're organised into three squads within the Platform Group; Infrastructure Platform, Backend Platform and Stateful Platform. Each squad is responsible for solving a specific set of problems for our customers and our engineers. We're looking for engineers who are interested in joining any of these squads right now, but there are opportunities to move between them as you gain experience with our platform.
We've posted a good overview of our platform on our blog if you'd like to learn more.
We're investing a lot of up-front effort in building a scalable, secure, and extensible architecture for our millions of customers. Come and help us build a state-of-the-art microservices platform and build the kind of bank you want to use.
Our engineers have a variety of different backgrounds
We have several non-graduates; only some of us studied Computer Science; some of us have worked in huge companies; some have only ever worked in startups; others are former consultants. As long as you enjoy learning new things, we'd love to talk to you. We do not ask for formal qualifications or degree requirements for any of our engineering roles.
We are actively creating an equitable environment for all of our engineers to thrive
Diversity and inclusion are a priority for us and we are making sure we have lots of support for all of our people to grow at Monzo. We provide a sponsorship framework in Engineering for women and people of colour; all of our leaders are trained on privilege awareness and we are creating partnerships with organisations dedicated to supporting underrepresented groups. You can read more in our 2020 Diversity and Inclusion report.
Monzo works in project-based sprints in small, interdisciplinary teams
We have around 150 engineers out of roughly 1,400 people in total - and we have big ambitions. There are many interesting challenges ahead, and we're happy for people to move between teams or to specialise, whatever you prefer. As an engineer here you'd be able to work directly with anyone across the company, and we run regular knowledge-sharing sessions so you'll learn heaps about everything from how banks work to effective communication.
We encourage an open and transparent working environment
You can get involved in any aspect of the business you are interested in and, following Stripe's example, all emails in the company are visible in an email archive. We contribute to open source software as much as possible. We've also made our product roadmap public and give sneak peeks of features in our community forum. Our technology blog is a good place to learn even more about what we do!
At Monzo you will get to work with a lot of exciting new technology.
We rely heavily on the following tools and technologies:
Go to write our application code (we also use Go to write software to control and manage our platform)
AWS for most of our infrastructure
Kubernetes to schedule and run our services (Chris, our Technical Director of Platform and Reliability and Suhail, a Staff Engineer in our Platform Collective gave a great talk recently at re:Invent sharing an overview of our platform)
Prometheus to monitor everything! (see How we Monitor Monzo)
Envoy Proxy for our Service Mesh
Kafka for our asynchronous message queue
Cassandra for most persistent data storage
We also have three physical data centre sites with a number of leased lines to connect our cloud infrastructure to various payment systems
You should apply if:
Our open roles are for mid-level to senior candidates at present. Apply if:
the work we're doing sounds exciting!
you're a software engineer at heart and you're comfortable writing software to solve problems
you're interested in distributed systems and writing resilient, scalable software

you're familiar with some of our Platform technologies, or specialise in just one part
you want to help build, scale and operate a platform to support a product that you (and everyone you know) use every day
you're keen to learn more about new technologies and the arcane inner workings of the financial industry
you're comfortable working in a team that deals with ambiguity
Logistics
Salary ranges between £70,000 - £116,000 plus stock options and other benefits.
We can help you relocate to London & we can sponsor visas.
This role can be based in our London office, but we're open to distributed working (as long as you can occasionally visit our London offices - usually a couple of days a month).
We're usually always hiring for engineers, so there's no closing date for this job.
We offer flexible working hours and trust you to work enough hours to do your job well, at times that suit you and your team.
Diversity and inclusion is a priority for us – if we want to solve problems for people around the world, our team has to represent our customers. So we need to attract the best talent and create an environment that supports and includes them. You can read more about diversity and inclusion on our blog.
If you prefer to work part-time, we'll make this happen whenever we can - whether this is to help you meet other commitments or strike a great work-life balance.
Our interview process is normally a phone interview, a coding task and call to discuss it, and 2-3 hours of onsite interviews that can be conducted via hangouts as well. We promise not to ask you any brain teasers or trick questions. We might design a system together on a whiteboard, the same way we often work together, but we won't make you write code on one.
Equal Opportunity Statement
At Monzo, embracing diversity in all of its forms and fostering an inclusive environment for all people to do the best work of their lives with us. This is integral to our mission of making money work for everyone.
We're an equal opportunity employer. All applicants will be considered for employment without attention to ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, family or parental status, national origin, veteran, neurodiversity status or disability status.

NERC’s Digital Solutions programme was created to develop innovative digital services that deliver economic, societal, and environmental benefits across the UK. It has been designed to move beyond just academic use and exploitation of existing data holdings. Our ethos is to build a Digital Solutions Hub as a gateway to a broad set of inter-connected toolkits that facilitate improved access and better use of NERC data. These may already exist, or will be created with our partners, which include the NHS, Defra, PHE and HSE, as well as local and regional SMEs and individual members of society. Providing easier access to NERC's environmental data offers opportunities for improving peoples' health and better understanding the impacts of climate change on people, land, and property across the UK.

The goal of Payments is to ensure that making and receiving a payment is a seamless, safe and delightful experience. We're at the heart of the bank and own some of the core infrastructure and services that make Monzo, Monzo… Hello Hot Coral Cards
Engineering squads within Payments carry out a mixture of project and operational work to generate revenue, automate manual processes, implement key controls and stay compliant with the various payment schemes we participate in.
Previous payments team projects have included building our very own Mastercard processor (from scratch), replacing a third-party Faster Payments Gateway with our own internal gateway, improving the international money transfer experience for our customers and supporting other teams within Monzo as they build innovative new features and services using our Payments infrastructure e.g. Monzo Flex, virtual cards & Monzo Pay. We've delivered industry leading Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) and 3D Secure V2 (3DSV2) implementations. And we make sure our critical payments infrastructure and services continue to be reliable, correct and high performing.
At the moment we're very interested in finding a specific 'shape' of backend engineer: someone who's had some experience within a payments focused engineering team working with other engineers and disciplines and potentially leading projects. As a senior engineer within payments you should expect to split your time between writing code, designing systems and services, mentoring other engineers, and working with your squad to make project decisions, estimates and risk based prioritisation.
Monzo works in project-based sprints in small, interdisciplinary teams
We have around 150 engineers out of roughly 1,400 people in total - and we have big ambitions. There are many interesting challenges ahead, and we're happy for people to move between teams or to specialise, whatever you prefer. As a senior engineer here you'd be able to work directly with folks from across the company, and we run regular knowledge-sharing sessions so you'll learn heaps about everything from how banks work to effective communication.
At Monzo you will get to work with a lot of exciting new technology.
We rely heavily on the following tools and technologies:

Redgate makes software to help companies and professionals get the most out of their databases. Our products are designed to work for everyone – from the smallest, single developer houses to Fortune 500 companies. We succeed by reliably solving our customers’ problems with ingeniously simple software.

We’re looking for experienced software engineers to join one of our product teams. If you’re passionate about writing great code, love working in a team, and want to shape the software you build, we want to hear from you.

At Redgate, we believe that the best software comes from engaging small teams with clear purpose, freedom to act, and a drive to learn.

Achieving work life balance has never been more important and so Redgate has adopted a flexible-hybrid model. This means that people will work flexibly with a blend of remote (home) and co-located (office) work, with teams having the flexibility to decide which location best suits the outcomes they need to deliver.

Where you work and how frequently you attend the office will depend on the nature of your role, make-up of the team and the type of work that you need to do. A weekly visit to the office is likely for most people to support our collaborative culture and enable our teams to deliver great work, though less frequent visits may also work well. So, if you are able to travel to & from the office safely in a day, that works well for us.

Development at Redgate
You’ll be involved in all stages of software development: from research calls with customers to pushing your code through our automated build system and making those all-important deployments.

Most of our code is written in C# (with a growing number of products using web technologies including TypeScript and React). We use GitHub for source control and TeamCity for continuous integration. Every software engineer gets all the hardware they need (fast machines and multiple monitors are standard), and freedom in choosing the software tools they’re comfortable with.

We take personal development seriously at Redgate. We run frequent lightning talks, open spaces (mini conferences run by Redgate engineers), and a yearly Down Tools Week. We have a healthy budget for attending conferences, and the last three years we’ve even held our own with all sessions run by Redgate employees.

What makes you a Redgate Software Engineer
Excellent skills using a modern object-oriented language – we predominately use C#, but any similar language requires the skillset we’re looking for.
You appreciate making things simple isn’t always easy and strive for simplicity in the code you write and the products you build.
You thrive in a highly collaborative team of software engineers and are enthusiastic about engaging with customers, designers, and product managers as necessary to create great products and services.
(desirable) You have domain expertise in one or more of Redgate’s product areas.
(desirable) You have experience working within an agile development team, with knowledge of practices such as TDD, BDD and continuous delivery.

Package
A great benefits package
You'll work about 40 hours per week, with flexible work time
We dedicate Friday afternoons to personal development, community and innovation
Salary is £45,000 to £50,000 (depending on experience)

At Redgate we recruit on a rolling basis, which means we carry on recruiting until we find the right person for the role. We tend to compare individuals to the role specification rather than to each other.

Redgate is happy to fully fund all charges related to the successful applicant obtaining a Skilled Worker Visa if needed. We also assist with both the financial costs and logistics of your move to the UK.",47500.0,2,£43000.0 - £57500.0,50250.0

We really care about people. We want you to grow with us in an open and supportive environment. We want to hear your ideas and for you to be yourself in an atmosphere that embraces people’s individual personalities.
