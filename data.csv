(Holiday note: We usually respond within 24 hours but are taking a break at the end of December 2021. Expect a response in early January.)
Lindus Health is looking for a software engineer (full-stack engineer, backend engineer or frontend engineer) to build the platform powering the next generation of clinical trials. Join a small team in the early stages of product development and grow your skills as we scale the product to manage complex trials and bring new treatments to patients faster!
About us
Clinical trials are in crisis. The industry hasn't changed in 30 years, and the cost of bringing new medicines to market is skyrocketing as a result.
Lindus Health’s mission is to fix this. We accelerate clinical trials, so patients can benefit. We’re building the world’s first full stack clinical trial platform, to conduct faster, safer clinical trials on behalf of companies developing new treatments, and lowering the barriers to participation for patients.
Since launching the company in March 2021 we have helped find over 5,000 patients for more than 25 clinical trials in areas like type 2 diabetes, COVID-19 diagnostics and mental health. We closed a $5m seed round to grow our platform and team.

About you
Our wish list for this role looks something like this:
You have 2 years or more experience as a software engineer collaborating in a team
You’re a full-stack engineer, or you specialize in backend or frontend development - at this point we have a need for both generalists and specialists. Backend: You have some experience with Python/Django or similar frameworks (e.g., Flask, Ruby on Rails, Node/Express). Frontend: You have some experience with a modern client framework (e.g., React, Vue, Ember).
You are product-minded: you want to understand why we are building something to figure out the best how in collaboration with product managers, UX designers and users.
You want to be a part of building a new team and new products from scratch. You like an early-stage startup environment where you have autonomy and opportunities to grow in all areas that interest you.
You belong here! If your experience and interests match with some of the above, we want you to apply.

What will you do?
In your first month:
Learn about clinical trials and the problems we are trying to solve from our co-founders, medical lead and trial managers
Collaborate with the product team on a starter project, make your first commits and your first deploys
Become familiar with the core components of our stack (React, TypeScript, Django, Python, Postgres, Amazon ECS)
In your first 3 months:
Become a part of the regular product development cycle where you work for example on features to collect data from trial participants and to help trial staff keep track of progress
Observe the product being used in real trials and support the team in responding to feature requests and bug reports
Within your first year:
Take on responsibility for substantial new features and facilitate related architecture and design decisions
Shape our engineering practices and work on making the team more productive in areas such as testing, CI, deployment pipelines, cloud architecture
Help grow the product & engineering team by interviewing candidates, onboarding new hires and possibly mentoring junior engineers
What we offer
Base salary based on experience in the range £55K to £80K, plus 0.1% - 0.3% stock options
Unlimited holidays; everyone is encouraged to take off at least 28 days each year
Flexible office arrangement; come into the office in London (near Victoria station) as often as you like, or work remotely (within the UK)
Monthly team events and days out (pandemic permitting); recently we've been to Legoland, and a Millwall FC home game (decided by popular vote)
If working mostly remotely: regular all-expenses paid trips to London to see the whole team (pandemic permitting)
Up to £500 towards setting up your home office
A new laptop as your main workstation
UK visa sponsorship if you’re not already eligible to work in the UK
Our technology strategy
Collaboration rocks. We like processes that emphasize openness and knowledge sharing across disciplines, across hierarchies and across time. We acknowledge that sharing, discussing and documenting their work means a certain amount of overhead for individuals, but this is more than offset in the long run by a culture of healthy teams and individual growth.
Iterate with abandon. We recognize that we often don’t know what the heck we’re doing when we start working on a new feature or technical problem, but we know that our understanding will improve as we start down a path to a particular solution. We favor tools and processes that support rapid iteration and frequent validation through user feedback and metrics.
Favor boring technology. We choose languages, frameworks, libraries, architectures and tools that are well-established in order to focus on the part that's hard and exciting and accelerates clinical trials the most: product development. We like a mature technology that has been around for at least a decade with abundant documentation and a large community around it. We deviate from this norm in targeted areas of innovation relevant to the business.
Related reading: Boring Technology (Dan McKinley), Buy vs build (Camille Fournier)
Test in production. We recognize that the last steps of integration and productionization of a new feature are hard - often harder than writing the code in the first place. We favor tools and processes that let us deploy to production early and often and as confidently as possible. We believe that deep insight into how their code behaves with real data and real users is crucial for engineers to get better at their craft.

Our hiring process for engineers
Send your resume to jobs@lindushealth.com. We welcome all applicants regardless of gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, religion, civil or family status, age, disability, or race. If Lindus Health’s mission resonates with you, we want you to apply! We commit to responding to you within 24 hours (weekends and holidays excepted).
Initial call with a co-founder (30 minutes): This is your opportunity to learn more about Lindus Health. We want to tell you about our mission and what we're doing to revolutionise health research.
Technical discussion with Nik, our CTO and a co-founder (90 minutes): This is a session in two parts where we figure out whether your technical skills mesh with our team. We deliberately don’t demand you write code or solve algorithm puzzles in real time, though you have the option to do a coding challenge at your own pace if you like.
Part 1: Code. You can choose between talking about a piece of code you’ve already written or complete a coding challenge at home that we then talk about. In the first option, you share a piece of your code that you think is interesting. We will walk through the code together and discuss your thought process, challenges you’ve faced and potential refactorings. If you choose the second option you get instructions for a coding challenge that you can do at your own pace ahead of the discussion. The challenge is designed to take no more than 2 hours to complete.
Part 2: Architecture & practices. We will share a document with you in advance that explains our team’s current architecture choices and practices. We will discuss what appeals to you about it, what you would change and what you would add to it. As an early team member you will have a real say in evolving this.
Values interview (45 minutes): This is a conversation with 1 or 2 co-founders about our values and culture and also your chance to ask any questions you still have about Lindus Health.
Meeting the team (one or two calls of 30 mins, or an in-person meeting if you’re in London): At this stage you’ll want to get to know more of the people you’ll be working with. We’ll set up informal calls or meet you in person at our office near Victoria station in London.
Offer! If you've come this far, receive an offer and join the team to help us bring about the next generation of healthcare research. We move fast and usually make a decision within hours of your last meeting."

Kafka for our asynchronous message queue.
React for internal web dashboards.","At Monzo we're aiming to build the best current account in the world. We are always keen to hear from capable, creative engineers who want to help us accomplish that goal
Our backend engineers have a variety of different backgrounds
We have several non-graduates; only some of us studied Computer Science; one of the team has a degree in Marketing; some of us have worked in huge companies; some have only ever worked in startups; others are former consultants. As long as you enjoy learning new things, we'd love to talk to you. We do not ask for formal qualifications or degree requirements for any of our engineering roles.
We are actively creating an equitable environment for all of our engineers to thrive
Diversity and inclusion are a priority for us and we are making sure we have lots of support for all of our people to grow at Monzo. We provide a sponsorship framework in Engineering for women and people of colour; all of our leaders are trained on privilege awareness and we are creating partnerships with organisations dedicated to supporting underrepresented groups. You can read more in our 2020 Diversity and Inclusion report.
We encourage an open and transparent working environment
You can get involved in any aspect of the business you are interested in and, following Stripe's example, all emails in the company are visible in an email archive. We contribute to open source software as much as possible. Our blog is a good place to learn even more about what we do!
Monzo works in project-based sprints in small, interdisciplinary teams
We have around 150 engineers out of roughly 1,400 people in total - and we have big ambitions. There are many interesting challenges ahead, and we're happy for people to move between teams or to specialise, whatever you prefer. As an engineer here you'd be able to work directly with anyone across the company, and we run regular knowledge-sharing sessions so you'll learn heaps about everything from how banks work to effective communication.
At Monzo you will get to work with a lot of exciting new technology.
We rely heavily on the following tools and technologies:
Go to write our application code (there's an excellent interactive Go tutorial here)
Cassandra for most persistent data storage
Kafka for our asynchronous message queue
Envoy Proxy for RPC
Kubernetes and Docker to schedule and run our services (Oliver, our VP Architecture, gave a great talk at KubeCon on how we use these technologies)
AWS for most of our infrastructure
React for internal web dashboards
We also have two physical datacenter sites with actual cables to connect to various third parties
Our product squads are truly cross-functional.
This role is all about collaborating across disciplines to test hypotheses and make a difference to customers. As a product backend engineer you'll work in a squad alongside product managers, marketers, user researchers, designers, mobile engineers, web engineers, data analysts, business analysts, writers and more!
Together you'll build and support a particular part of Monzo. Our product squads belong to one of four collectives (a word we use to describe self-governing business units of ~100 people). They are: Growth & Core, Borrowing, Operations and Money. They're all looking for additional Backend Engineers right now.
The Growth & Core collective helps people to discover Monzo and make the most of it.
Growth & Core is a collective focused on different aspects of our mission to 'make money work for everyone' and it has four squads. They make users effortlessly financially savvy with features like Budgeting, Pots and the Salary Sorter. Many of the customer problems they solve are revenue opportunities, too – like Monzo Plus, Business Banking, and the Savings marketplace. Last year they also launched our Open Banking APIs, shipped a simpler and more future-proof navigation structure, and enabled Monzo customers to get their salary paid a day early for free!
The Borrowing collective makes borrowing money simple, fair and transparent.
We're really proud that this fair approach to lending helps people to get what they want from life on their own terms. Squads in Borrowing have already shipped and scaled overdrafts to hundreds of thousands of Monzo customers. They've made it easy to take out a loan without the unfair fees or confusing pricing that you find elsewhere. They work on everything from the way borrowing works in the app, right down to how they move and account for money that our customers borrow. One of the most interesting problems they face is deciding how much to lend and to whom. The team believes that they can make access to credit fairer and more transparent.
The Operations collective is responsible for our incredible customer support.
The Operations collective looks after one of the most interesting problem spaces at Monzo: as we grow, we want to ensure that we're using technology as effectively as possible whilst still maintaining customer service so good that you want to tell your friends. Our engineers within this area of the business help us to explore these challenges. Central to it all is Monzo Chat – a completely bespoke bit of software we've built from the ground up to manage chats in our app - but we're also doing work with machine learning, and looking at how technology can more broadly support our wonderful support team (we call them COps) in other aspects.
The Money collective helps Monzo move fast and in control with our money
We are the bank within the bank and are responsible for the core infrastructure and banking services you associate with Monzo. We are the Guardians of the Monzo Ledger and own everything related to our distinctive Hot Coral cards.
Engineering squads within the Money collective carry out a variety of payments and finance related work, we built our very own Mastercard processor from scratch and recently we successfully replaced a third-party Faster Payments Gateway with our own internal Gateway to reduce outages we can't control. On top of this we've been ensuring our payment schemes are compliant with key regulatory requirements such as Strong Customer Authentication (SCA), 3D Secure V2 (3DSV2), making sure that our core infrastructure and services will scale to support our ambitious growth plans and that we always know where our money is and can report accurately and reliably on it.
The financial crime at Monzo team focuses on making sure our services are a hostile environment for criminals
We tackle all financial crime together as one team, this includes money laundering, fraud, sanctions breaches, terrorist financing, bribery and corruption and tax evasion. Engineers get to work on core services that are consumed by many different products which means we have a really broad perspective. We've had some major successes in combating financial crime, most famously The Ticketmaster Breach where we spotted large-scale fraudulent activity due to a Ticketmaster data breach before Ticketmaster or other banks did.
The TechOps team
The TechOps team are challenging the traditional IT model by building a brand new people platform to automate all aspects of a Monzo staff member's time here. We're building an industry leading people platform to support our staff in a delightful way and to accommodate rapid growth across multiple countries. This approach will allow us to empower our staff by providing smart, efficient and powerful tools instead of relying on traditional IT systems and a horde of IT staff.
You should apply if
Our open roles are for mid-level to senior Backend Engineers at present.

you have strong experience working on the backend of a technology product
you think you'd enjoy the kind of work we're doing
you want to be involved in building a product that you (and the people you know) use every day
you have a product mindset: you care about customer outcomes and you want to make data-informed decisions
you're comfortable working in a team that deals with ambiguity
you're interested in distributed systems and writing resilient software
you have some experience with strongly-typed languages (Go, Java, C, Scala etc.).
Logistics
Salary is around £90,000 - £116,000 plus stock options and other benefits.
We can help you relocate to London & we can sponsor visas.
This role can be based in our London office, but we're open to distributed working (with ad hoc meetings in London once COVID is over).
We're usually always hiring for Backend Engineers, so there's no closing date for this job.
We offer flexible working hours and trust you to work enough hours to do your job well, at times that suit you and your team.
Diversity and inclusion is a priority for us – if we want to solve problems for people around the world, our team has to represent our customers. So we need to attract the best talent and create an environment that supports and includes them. You can read more about diversity and inclusion on our blog.
If you prefer to work part-time, we'll make this happen whenever we can - whether this is to help you meet other commitments or strike a great work-life balance.
Our interview process is normally a phone interview, a coding task and call to discuss it, and 2-3 hours of onsite interviews that can be conducted via hangouts as well. We promise not to ask you any brain teasers or trick questions. We might design a system together on a whiteboard, the same way we often work together, but we won't make you write code on one.
Equal Opportunity Statement
At Monzo, embracing diversity in all of its forms and fostering an inclusive environment for all people to do the best work of their lives with us. This is integral to our mission of making money work for everyone.
We're an equal opportunity employer. All applicants will be considered for employment without attention to ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, family or parental status, national origin, veteran, neurodiversity status or disability status.

Why Sigma Labs?
There are loads of companies that look like us: FDM, Sparta, Futureproof, Digital Futures, Kubrick, Xandertalent, M3, QA, etc. all promise pretty much the same thing: 6 to 12 week technical training (free), then hopefully a 2 year job with a salary between £21k and £30k working with one of their clients (and if you leave in that period you have to pay back the cost of the training, usually £10k to £20k);
So why us?
Judge us by what we say and do: start with how many companies tell you about their competitors;
We are a start-up education b-corp that invests in people through world class training: this does not mean we’ll teach you what you want to learn, for example if you dead set on only being a ‘full stack java developer’, then we’re probably not right for you. We focus on technology consultants (primarily teaching software & data engineering but covering a large number of roles from software development to test engineers). In addition we cover high performance professional skills (based on the Bain graduate programme) that will enable you to excel longer terms. As you excel, our clients excel and we recover the cost of the training.
We have worked at and our investors come from some of the world’s most renowned companies, from BCG & McKinsey to Unilever, The Guardian and Google. We are all driven by interested in high performance;
What we offer?
The Training: a free 12 to 16 week intense programme covering software & data engineering: from JavaScript, SQL and Python to industry best practices (OOP, TDD & Agile). As important is the training in high performance personal & professional behaviour (from interviewing to problem solving);
The Role: after the training our laser focus is to find you a client and employ you on a £30,000 salary. You’ll work with our clients for 2 years helping them solve real world problems, while we continue to develop you technically & professionally. If we fail to find you a role with us, we’ll still try and help you find a role somewhere;
The Goal: at the end of the 2 years working for us, you'll join our network: >100 senior managers at some of the world's leading organisations, all committed to help Sigma Labs alumni long term. You should be able to earn £40k+ at this point.
What we're looking for?
The key is not the subject but that you do these things yourself. This is how you would honestly describe yourself:
A Problem Solver: logical, mathematical, scientific, philosophical, human….you name it;
A Good Communicator: this doesn’t mean charisma. You put effort into being understood;
Conscientious: you like doing great work for other people - a combination of ambition & niceness;
Curious: you’re interested in things - from coding to plants or languages to crypto;
Persistent: you don’t get phased by problems. You know to break them down, not give up and learn.
Eligibility Criteria: you must have…
Economic: at least one of the following: grown up in a household with income < £43k, attended a non-academically selective state school, been eligible for free school meals or local authority care;
Education:
2:2 or higher (the subject isn’t important but you’re comfortable with numbers); or if you didn’t get a 2:2 or higher but still graduated, then you received at least an A or B in one STEM subject. We need to know that you’re ok with numbers and enjoy solving problems;
Right to work in the UK: UK Passport, EU/EEA Settled Status, Indefinite Leave to Remain (unfortunately we cannot sponsor Visas).
Location: the training will be predominantly online but we will also invite you to our London office at times as face-to-face interactions are difficult to beat.
The Application Process: Apply for our March 2022 or July 2022 cohort now! We provide clear tips on how to do well on the application but you can also easily book a quick call if you’d like to find out more. Please note that applications are considered on a first-come first-serve basis.

They have since assembled a talented and diverse team of legal, software and machine learning engineers to build the next generation of contracting tools.

Robin AI is an exciting, venture-backed technology startup whose mission is to dramatically reduce the cost and complexity of legal advice. Backed by top London based VCs, Forward Partners and Episode 1, Robin uses a combination of human and artificial intelligence to review and edit contracts and is building software to fundamentally change the legal industry forever.

Robin was established in March 2019 by CEO Richard Robinson (a former City lawyer) and CTO James Clough (a theoretical physicist who works in Machine Learning). They have since assembled a talented and diverse team of legal, software and machine learning engineers to build the next generation of contracting tools.

At Robin AI, we create groundbreaking products that are transforming legal teams. Our work is multi-disciplinary and brings together the best talent in engineering, AI and the law. Our current product uses neural networks to read and comprehend written contracts, assesses whether they adhere to our customers’ preferred positions, and then automatically amends them. But our ambitions go way beyond reviewing contracts – we want to build technology that changes the way companies all over the world do deals.

To do that, we need to build. Specifically, we want to build a new, structured way for businesses to make and agree contracts by replacing the outdated Microsoft Word workflow with a browser-based, visual contract building application that will empower anyone to create a world class contract without a lawyer. Just like Figma has democratised design tools, and WebFlow has democratised website development, we want to give business owners, HR teams, procurement teams and in-house lawyers all over the world the ability to create and negotiate any business contract by combining legal, design, software and machine learning expertise.

The Role
You will help us build software that will allow our customers to create contracts from a library of templates, and quickly review and edit contracts sent to them by counter-parties. You’ll also help us develop our machine learning service which can automatically edit contracts and explain the changes to the user in plain English. And you’ll help us build an intelligent contract repository that will help companies save thousands of hours searching for information trapped inside their contracts. We’ve already made great progress towards this product vision, but you will play a pivotal role in making it a reality.
Tech Stack
Our frontend is built using React and Apollo, and we use Python web frameworks, such as Django and Flask, to implement our back-end services, alongside various other services and libraries such as Celery and Elasticsearch. Everything runs on AWS services, including but not limited to ECS, Lambda and SQS. We use CircleCI to build and deploy, and all of our infrastructure is managed using Terraform.
Responsibilities
Develop back-end services and API’s using Django and similar Python frameworks;
Build and maintain the Infrastructure our products and components are deployed to;
Write high quality, well tested code that solves challenging problems;
Identify and prioritise tasks, taking into account company objectives and goals.
Your Skills
You enjoy working across the stack, and have experience with Python frameworks such as Django and Flask, and Cloud Infrastructure (e.g. AWS)
Have a background working in a start-up or similar size organisation and are passionate about building high quality products
Have an in-depth understanding of the entire development process (design, development and deployment)

You will enjoy working in a stimulating, diverse and intellectually challenging environment where collaboration is essential to achieving results. You should have at least two years experience working in an engineering team and be confident managing your own schedule while achieving measurable results. Experience working with Machine Learning/Data science models isn’t a pre-requisite, but it is a bonus – so let us know if you’ve worked in the space or have an interest in it.

Tightening regulatory requirements, reduced subsidies and changing sustainability needs of the society. These are a few of the wider trends in the sector that require farmers to change their approach and sharpen their focus. Data and technology give farmers the insight and opportunity to reverse the long-term decline in profitability and optimise their businesses for the future.
Want to make a difference?
Yagro is on a mission to help farmers become more financially sustainable, by offering breakthrough software tools and commercial insight. We’re developing a trusted, independent data platform for farmers to gain visibility and control over their business and get the edge in the market.

Up for a challenge?
We are an established, award-winning leader in commercial AgTech software, with hundreds of UK farming customers, strong revenue since launch in 2016, and long term financial support to reach our mission: make farming profitable and sustainable.
We are operating within an industry characterised by manual processes and poor information exchange. We need to distil a complex and opaque supply chain with multiple actors into a simple, elegant and scalable multi-user platform, with industry-leading analytics and data insights.
That’s where you come in.
You’ll join the core engineering team at Yagro, an experienced and ambitious group of people, and will play a role in shaping and delivering the company’s vision to 2025 and beyond.

What are we looking for?
A smart developer who has experience delivering great quality products to customers.
This is a web service, so knowledge of databases, web frameworks, browsers, mobile apps, UI and UX.
Someone who cares about the whole development process: with a small team we have to take the responsibility for design, research, testing, deployments and operations.
Responsibility, as you will own projects.
An active participant in a learning environment and desire to iteratively improve yourself, the team and the company as a whole.
No time for nonsense – just love getting stuff done.
Above all, you’re excited by our vision and share our core values: we’re always learning; always looking for new challenges; we inspire each other; we are open and honest; we trust each other and aren’t afraid to give or accept responsibility and autonomy; and we have fun!

You'll help us with the following questions and challenges:
Securing our critical infrastructure, such as Kubernetes, Cassandra, Kafka, and the AWS services, Data Centres and networks they rely on;
Providing and managing the foundational infrastructure for other Security and Platform Engineering squads to build upon;
Managing our secrets, keys and certificates to ensure our systems are airtight;
Automating access control and permissioning for our cloud infrastructure.
Here are some of the projects the team have worked on in the past:
Controlling outbound traffic from Kubernetes
Building our secret management platform
Building network isolation for 1,500 services
The role
You'll be responsible for:
Ensuring that our cloud infrastructure and physical data centres are secure;
Building a deep understanding of the security of key technologies such as Vault, Kubernetes, Cassandra, Teleport and AWS and how we can improve them;
Performing threat modelling to mitigate the most important attack vectors against our infrastructure.
Monzo's security team has a wide range of responsibilities. As a bank, we are solving diverse, novel problems to ensure that our customers and their data are secure.
One of the guiding principles of security at Monzo is that security at the expense of user experience is a last resort. We aim to move mountains in the background so that we can build world-class features without compromising on security.
As a Backend Engineer in Security you'd be able to work directly with lots of teams across the company, and we run regular knowledge-sharing sessions so you'll learn heaps about everything; from how banks work to effective communication and the technologies we use.
You should apply if
You have experience in software engineering (we use Go, but we're open to all backgrounds) and you're excited about solving large-scale infrastructure security problems.
You're comfortable securing cloud-based environments and networks, and wrangling with code at this level of abstraction.
You're passionate about security and understand best practices.
You're constantly looking for flaws in systems and can reason about how best to address them.
Logistics
Salary ranges between £75,000 - £100,000 plus stock options and other benefits.
We can help you relocate to London & we can sponsor visas.
This role can be based in our London office, but we're open to distributed working.
We have payroll set up in four countries: the UK, Ireland, and France. Right now, we can only hire people who work from those countries and we'll keep this updated with new ones as we expand and are able to hire from more places
We offer flexible working hours and trust you to work enough hours to do your job well, at times that suit you and your team.
Diversity and inclusion is a priority for us – if we want to solve problems for people around the world, our team has to represent our customers. So we need to attract the best talent and create an environment that supports and includes them. You can read more about diversity and inclusion on our blog.
If you prefer to work part-time, we'll make this happen whenever we can - whether this is to help you meet other commitments or strike a great work-life balance.
Our interview process is normally an initial phone interview followed by a take-home task and call to discuss it (or alternatively a paired-programming exercise), if successful you will move to a final round of 3 separate interviews conducted via hangouts. We promise not to ask you any brain teasers or trick questions. We might design a system together on a whiteboard, the same way we often work together, but we won't make you write code on one.
Equal Opportunity Statement
At Monzo, embracing diversity in all of its forms and fostering an inclusive environment for all people to do the best work of their lives with us. This is integral to our mission of making money work for everyone.
We're an equal opportunity employer. All applicants will be considered for employment without attention to ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, family or parental status, national origin, veteran, neurodiversity status or disability status.
What is Monzo about?
We're a bank on a mission to make money work for everyone. By focusing on solving real problems rather than selling financial products, treating people fairly and being totally transparent, we believe we can make banking better.
Monzo started in 2015 with big plans and a little office in Shoreditch, London. Now we're a fully-licensed bank with millions of customers in the UK, and well over a thousand employees around the world.

We are always keen to hear from capable, creative engineers who want to help us accomplish that goal
We're currently looking for Senior Backend Engineers to join our Platform team.
We're looking for engineers with experience working with Platforms who are software engineers at heart - you're as comfortable writing software to solve problems as you are operating AWS or Kubernetes. If you're a software engineer who has some good cloud infrastructure experience already, or you're eager to get really familiar with systems, tooling and libraries, this could be the role for you.
As a team, we're responsible for designing, building, and operating the services we consume from AWS, along with the software we run on top like Kubernetes, Cassandra, Prometheus, and Kafka. We're also responsible for operating our two physical data centres, our network, and being on-call for the things we own and run.
To achieve this, we're organised into three squads within the Platform Group; Infrastructure Platform, Backend Platform and Stateful Platform. Each squad is responsible for solving a specific set of problems for our customers and our engineers. We're looking for engineers who are interested in joining any of these squads right now, but there are opportunities to move between them as you gain experience with our platform.
We've posted a good overview of our platform on our blog if you'd like to learn more.
We're investing a lot of up-front effort in building a scalable, secure, and extensible architecture for our millions of customers. Come and help us build a state-of-the-art microservices platform and build the kind of bank you want to use.
Our engineers have a variety of different backgrounds
We have several non-graduates; only some of us studied Computer Science; some of us have worked in huge companies; some have only ever worked in startups; others are former consultants. As long as you enjoy learning new things, we'd love to talk to you. We do not ask for formal qualifications or degree requirements for any of our engineering roles.
We are actively creating an equitable environment for all of our engineers to thrive
Diversity and inclusion are a priority for us and we are making sure we have lots of support for all of our people to grow at Monzo. We provide a sponsorship framework in Engineering for women and people of colour; all of our leaders are trained on privilege awareness and we are creating partnerships with organisations dedicated to supporting underrepresented groups. You can read more in our 2020 Diversity and Inclusion report.
Monzo works in project-based sprints in small, interdisciplinary teams
We have around 150 engineers out of roughly 1,400 people in total - and we have big ambitions. There are many interesting challenges ahead, and we're happy for people to move between teams or to specialise, whatever you prefer. As an engineer here you'd be able to work directly with anyone across the company, and we run regular knowledge-sharing sessions so you'll learn heaps about everything from how banks work to effective communication.
We encourage an open and transparent working environment
You can get involved in any aspect of the business you are interested in and, following Stripe's example, all emails in the company are visible in an email archive. We contribute to open source software as much as possible. We've also made our product roadmap public and give sneak peeks of features in our community forum. Our technology blog is a good place to learn even more about what we do!
At Monzo you will get to work with a lot of exciting new technology.
We rely heavily on the following tools and technologies:
Go to write our application code (we also use Go to write software to control and manage our platform)
AWS for most of our infrastructure
Kubernetes to schedule and run our services (Chris, our Technical Director of Platform and Reliability and Suhail, a Staff Engineer in our Platform Collective gave a great talk recently at re:Invent sharing an overview of our platform)
Prometheus to monitor everything! (see How we Monitor Monzo)
Envoy Proxy for our Service Mesh

We have close links to industry, the public sector and the local community, and we are firmly committed to furthering knowledge, enabling achievement and encouraging social responsibility both amongst our cosmopolitan community of staff and students, and in the wider world. The University has a world-class research profile, outstanding facilities and support services, and has an institutional goal of being among the world's top 25 universities in terms of its research.
Research IT provides research-focussed, specialist computing infrastructure, software engineering, data science, application support and training to researchers across a wide range of domains, who have diverse technical requirements. Our scope includes the support of disciplines that may not traditionally be regarded as IT-intensive; for example the increasing importance of digital technologies within various lines of Humanities research. Our support ranges from advice on available applications packages, and handling simple enquiries for those getting started, through to more in-depth bug fixing, coding and software development which may require days, weeks or months of effort.
As a member of the Research IT team, you will be responsible for providing software engineering expertise to researchers, research projects and our own platforms while working on engagements from a few weeks to many months in duration. You will work on research projects from conception to completion, gathering requirements, helping with grant applications, implementing, and documenting as required.

It has been designed to move beyond just academic use and exploitation of existing data holdings. Our ethos is to build a Digital Solutions Hub as a gateway to a broad set of inter-connected toolkits that facilitate improved access and better use of NERC data. These may already exist, or will be created with our partners, which include the NHS, Defra, PHE and HSE, as well as local and regional SMEs and individual members of society. Providing easier access to NERC's environmental data offers opportunities for improving peoples' health and better understanding the impacts of climate change on people, land, and property across the UK. Indeed, initially we will focus on two areas 'Connected Healthy Nation' and 'A Climate Ready Nation' as use cases. It is expected, as the programme develops, more use cases will come online.
We are interested in receiving applications from people who have extensive experience in the complete software engineering lifecycle and who have a passion for supporting researchers. We are particularly keen to hear from people who have experience in one or more of Data Science, Geospatial Analysis, Data Visualisation, User Experience and Sustainable and Reproducible Research. The ideal candidate will be able to demonstrate proficiency with one or more programming languages such as, but not limited to, Python, R, C, C++, C#, Java, Fortran and Shell.
In your application please ensure you make clear reference to the domains, languages and technologies you have experience of. Research IT will provide training in other areas as part of your career progression.
We are looking for enthusiastic team members who are able to learn new skills, can communicate effectively with researchers and colleagues (whatever their IT ability), and are keen to work on a diverse range of problems ranging from giving immediate answers to working for or alongside researchers on projects that may last from days to months.
As an equal opportunities employer we welcome applicants from all sections of the community regardless of age, sex, gender (or gender identity), ethnicity, disability, sexual orientation and transgender status. All appointments are made on merit.

We are always keen to hear from capable, creative engineers who want to help us accomplish that goal
Our backend engineers have a variety of different backgrounds
We have several non-graduates; only some of us studied Computer Science; one of the team has a degree in Marketing; some of us have worked in huge companies; some have only ever worked in startups; others are former consultants. As long as you enjoy learning new things, we'd love to talk to you. We do not ask for formal qualifications or degree requirements for any of our engineering roles.
We are actively creating an equitable environment for all of our engineers to thrive
Diversity and inclusion are a priority for us and we are making sure we have lots of support for all of our people to grow at Monzo. We provide a sponsorship framework in Engineering for women and people of colour; all of our leaders are trained on privilege awareness and we are creating partnerships with organisations dedicated to supporting underrepresented groups. You can read more in our 2020 Diversity and Inclusion report.
We encourage an open and transparent working environment
You can get involved in any aspect of the business you are interested in and, following Stripe's example, all emails in the company are visible in an email archive. We contribute to open source software as much as possible. Our blog is a good place to learn even more about what we do!
Payments
The goal of Payments is to ensure that making and receiving a payment is a seamless, safe and delightful experience. We're at the heart of the bank and own some of the core infrastructure and services that make Monzo, Monzo… Hello Hot Coral Cards
Engineering squads within Payments carry out a mixture of project and operational work to generate revenue, automate manual processes, implement key controls and stay compliant with the various payment schemes we participate in.
Previous payments team projects have included building our very own Mastercard processor (from scratch), replacing a third-party Faster Payments Gateway with our own internal gateway, improving the international money transfer experience for our customers and supporting other teams within Monzo as they build innovative new features and services using our Payments infrastructure e.g. Monzo Flex, virtual cards & Monzo Pay. We've delivered industry leading Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) and 3D Secure V2 (3DSV2) implementations. And we make sure our critical payments infrastructure and services continue to be reliable, correct and high performing.
At the moment we're very interested in finding a specific 'shape' of backend engineer: someone who's had some experience within a payments focused engineering team working with other engineers and disciplines and potentially leading projects. As a senior engineer within payments you should expect to split your time between writing code, designing systems and services, mentoring other engineers, and working with your squad to make project decisions, estimates and risk based prioritisation.
Monzo works in project-based sprints in small, interdisciplinary teams
We have around 150 engineers out of roughly 1,400 people in total - and we have big ambitions. There are many interesting challenges ahead, and we're happy for people to move between teams or to specialise, whatever you prefer. As a senior engineer here you'd be able to work directly with folks from across the company, and we run regular knowledge-sharing sessions so you'll learn heaps about everything from how banks work to effective communication.
At Monzo you will get to work with a lot of exciting new technology.
We rely heavily on the following tools and technologies:
We rely heavily on the following tools and technologies within Payments:
Go to write our application code (there's an excellent interactive Go tutorial here)
Amazon Keyspaces for most persistent data storage (Recently replaced Cassandra)
Big Query for data reporting and analytics
Kafka for our asynchronous message queue
Envoy Proxy for RPC
Kubernetes and Docker to schedule and run our services
AWS for most of our infrastructure
We also have two physical datacenter sites with actual cables to connect to different payment schemes such as Mastercard and SWIFT
You should apply if:
you have strong experience working on the backend of a technology product
you think you'd enjoy the kind of work we're doing
you like doing innovative work under the hood to make things work better
you want to be involved in building and maintaining services that power our award winning bank
you're keen to learn more about new technologies and the arcane inner workings of the payments industry
you're comfortable working in a fast paced environment in a team that deals with ambiguity
you have some experience with strongly-typed languages (Go, Java, C, Scala etc.)
you're strong on systems thinking and distributed design
Bonus points for (but not essential):
Experience working with payment schemes or within the financial services/fintech sector
team and project leadership experience
Logistics
Salary is around £90,000 - £116,000 plus stock options and other benefits.
We can help you relocate to London & we can sponsor visas.
This role can be based in our London office, but we're open to distributed working (with ad hoc meetings in London once COVID is over).
There's no closing date for this job.
We offer flexible working hours and trust you to work enough hours to do your job well, at times that suit you and your team.
Diversity and inclusion is a priority for us – if we want to solve problems for people around the world, our team has to represent our customers. So we need to attract the best talent and create an environment that supports and includes them. You can read more about diversity and inclusion on our blog.
If you prefer to work part-time, we'll make this happen whenever we can - whether this is to help you meet other commitments or strike a great work-life balance.
Our interview process is normally a phone interview, a coding task and call to discuss it, and 2-3 hours of onsite interviews that can be conducted via hangouts as well. We promise not to ask you any brain teasers or trick questions. We might design a system together on a whiteboard, the same way we often work together, but we won't make you write code on one.
Equal Opportunity Statement
At Monzo, embracing diversity in all of its forms and fostering an inclusive environment for all people to do the best work of their lives with us. This is integral to our mission of making money work for everyone.
We're an equal opportunity employer. All applicants will be considered for employment without attention to ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, family or parental status, national origin, veteran, neurodiversity status or disability status.

And when it comes to getting paid, people want their cash yesterday. But every year organizations waste time, money and energy sending more than $20 trillion in payouts to individuals using cash, checks, credit, debit, prepaid and gift cards! Held back by the legacy banking systems, crushed by the costs and complexity of credit cards there is this monster industry still lingering in the digital dark ages.
At WeGift we’re changing all that. We’ve built our own proprietary payment rails that enables any organisation to send money to any individual, anywhere, instantly. No bank account required. No insane interchange fees. We even get up to 20% in commissions from retailers for driving sales which we pass onto our customers. It’s discounted money! We’re throwing away the old model, and transforming how we move and use money forever.
We want amazing people like you to join us and be part of that journey.
We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, colour, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status.
For this role, we are able to sponsor candidates who require a Tier 2/skilled worker visa. We also offer a relocation package to help with your move to the UK.

Requirements
Our Team
We’re building a Product & Engineering team where people can do their best work that sits right at the heart of the business. We want to hire talented engineers who see WeGift as an opportunity to grow and to make an impact.
We have Python and TypeScript services running across Kubernetes (EKS) and Lambda functions. Our persistence is largely Aurora (Postgres), DynamoDB and their event triggers.
We have structures in place from hiring and levelling to how we make technical decisions that will allow the right people to thrive and we want world class engineers to be a part of that journey. We welcome applications from engineers from any programming language that are enthusiastic about cross-training to Python and Typescript.
The Role
As a Senior Software Engineer, you will be responsible for architecting, implementing and deploying software services from end to end. You’ll produce clean, scalable, and reusable code to build products which will have a big impact on our customers.
You will have the opportunity to work with a modern stack and serverless cloud infrastructure whilst guiding and mentoring more junior engineers in the team.
*
What Excites You*
Contributing towards the design, delivery and deployment of large scale, complex projects which are used heavily by thousands of people with high throughput.
Using modern technology like AWS serverless infrastructure and events driven microservice architecture
Mentoring more junior members of the team to help support their growth and development and to ensure the team is levelling up.
Being a subject matter expert on technology and domain-specific problems, and taking ownership of software services from end to end.
Improving responsiveness and overall performance of our web services.
Helping to scale the team by leading on technical interviews.
What Excites Us
Around 5+ years of Software Engineering experience architecting and developing new services and features from end to end.
The ability to take ownership of design and architecture of large scale systems and developing API heavy software solutions without the need for guidance.
A passion for promoting software engineering best practice, guiding and mentoring more junior engineers to deliver clean, scalable, and reusable code.
Proactively contributing to the continual improvement of our engineering processes
Some of the project you could be working on:
Integration into all physical stores and merchants with POS. Consumers can spend their value where they want to as we go beyond Gift Cards.
Continued development of our infrastructure. Transitioning to serverless infrastructure and microservices to enable us to scale rapidly as a team
Building a brand new internal tool chain. So non technical teams can on-board new payment partners
Building our wallet feature. Consumers can aggregate the value they accumulate and spend that digital value when and where they choose to.
Technical resilience. As we become more integral to our customers’ businesses, how can we make sure that we can continue to serve them even when there are technical or logistics issues upstream.
Recent examples of new features:
WeGift Select. This allows us to give the customer choice, and therefore go beyond simply reselling gift cards and towards our strategic vision of helping value to flow more freely in the global economy. This project was technically challenging due to a requirement for it to work across a wide selection of devices.
Self-serve brand on-boarding. WeGift is growing rapidly, which means we have to challenge ourselves to use technology to give a great experience to our brand partners without them needing a lot of support from the customer success team.
Ongoing integration with gift card processors. Right at the heart of WeGift’s operations, this technology needs to scale seamlessly and maintain high standards of reliability, maintainability and security. We’re also constantly asking ourselves how we can make this process more efficient - how can we make a capital investment now to reduce operational spend in the future, and that in turn requires a creative take on the underlying technology.

Private Medical Health Insurance with Bupa.
Visa sponsorship and relocation package opportunities.
A minimum of 25 days holiday + bank holidays (we’re not too descriptive about holidays so if you need more time off then just ask).
Participation in the Employee Options pool giving you ownership in WeGift and participation in the upside.
Pension scheme (3% contribution)
For the time being we are a remote-first company, however, from January 2022 we will be moving to a more hybrid structure to allow flexibility between home and office based working. You will therefore be expected to be in our London office (145 City Road, nr Old Street) a set number of days a month, agreed by your manager.
Generous maternity and paternity packages to make sure you get to spend time with your new bundle of joy.
£1,000 annual L&D allowance to invest in mastering your craft, including accredited studies.
Cycle to work scheme - save some £££ on buying a bike.
Regular virtual team socials.
Workplace Nursery benefit, where WeGift makes a contribution to your child's nursery for equipment, training, redecoration or anything else

Github PRs require the automated test suite to pass (which you will likely have added to), and…","About us
Cronofy's mission is to Schedule Everything For Everyone. Over the past 7 years we’ve grown a self-sustaining, profitable business on our enterprise-ready Scheduling API.
We’re now building a direct-to-user offering in the form of our Scheduler so we can improve the scheduling workflows of even more people.
The role
We’ve done the hard work of synchronising with all the major calendar services and pushing that data into our Availability Engine. We’re now doing the really hard work of making that power accessible to everyone, not just developers, in a way that respects their privacy.
Building such a product requires a different set of skills to building an API, and so we’re looking to expand our team. The ideal person loves to work where the ones and zeroes turn into fonts and shapes, but I want to talk to anyone who isn’t allergic to writing Javascript.
We are looking for a Software Developer who can, or aspire to, shepherd features from idea through to real-world usage, the experience to make the hundred small decisions along the way that requires, and the humility to ask for feedback at the right times.
We strive to enable people to look for guidance when needed, not permission, and to give you the resources to be self-sufficient and fulfill your potential. As a team we aim to work together to produce ideas and products greater than those we could alone.
About you
Practices such as pairing are neither mandated nor discouraged. We trust you to know how you work best, we only ask that you keep the team informed of your progress and ask for help when needed.
We're strong on compliance but this doesn't mean you have to deal with an arduous development process. Github PRs require the automated test suite to pass (which you will likely have added to), and approval by a peer, before they can be merged. From there, the build and deployment process is automated.
This all generates the audit trail necessary to show we follow our change management process.
Like all of our processes, they are lightweight, fit-for-purpose, and open to change when we find them lacking.
We pride ourselves on happy customers, so part of your responsibilities are fixing bugs, sharing the technical support, and improving our documentation to reduce the amount of direct support we need to provide.
Your capabilities
Our stack:
Terraform, AWS, Postgres, Redis, Kubernetes, Ruby on Rails, React, SASS form the core of our stack.
We also have Go in our toolset for situations where performance is paramount.
Familiarity with any of these is a benefit, none of them are essential as you’ll be smart enough to learn what’s necessary with our help.
How we work
Remote-first as an engineering team before the pandemic, we’re currently fully remote. We're starting to, carefully, resume meetings in person as the value of real-world interaction is high. Our team currently covers the Midlands, South of England, and Spain.
Meetups will happen in London where we have an office in a shared space, or Nottingham where our dedicated company HQ is.
As a team we have a daily sit-down, and weekly planning/review meetings. As a company we have a weekly all-hands call to share our work, successes, and challenges. We use our principles to guide our behaviour.
Team meetups are likely to be monthly once they can happen again, all travel and accommodation necessary are covered by the company through your own prepaid card.
In 2019 we held a company retreat, that was not possible in 2020 but it is something we would like to do at least annually.
Hiring process
The goal is to discover what you will bring to Cronofy and what Cronofy will bring to you. It's as important for you to determine whether this is the right move for your career as much as anything else, so don't be afraid to ask questions.
Initial call
During a 30 minute video call with our CTO, Garry, you’ll get to know each other a little. We’ll look to find out what you’re looking for in your next role as part of your career progression, your approach to growing software in a holistic sense, and the kind of support you need to do your best work.
You’ll have chance to ask any questions you may have about the role, the team, or the company. Please feel free to ask absolutely anything, in the worst case we won’t be able to answer specifically due to confidentiality or similar, but we’ll at least be able to give a holistic answer.
Coding exercise and discussion
All being well, we’ll ask you to do a coding exercise which shouldn’t take more than 60 minutes. It’s not about building a complete product, as much as a conversation starter for a second 30 minute call together where we’ll get a bit more technical.
Meet the team
From there, you’ll be invited to talk to other people from the team, similarly video calls of 15-30 minutes. These are as much for you to get a feel for the team, as for the team to provide feedback about you. I’d like you to speak to at least two people, but you can speak to as many as you need to feel comfortable that it’s a team you want to join. Like all stages this is a two-way conversation so you are free to interview them too.
Final stage
Usually at this point we would spend a morning or afternoon together, in current circumstances that’s not possible. Instead, we’d look to schedule a call split into three main sections, with breaks in between, along with Adam, our CEO and co-founder. Those sections are:
Work history - this helps us better understand your professional background
A “whiteboard discussion” - this gives us another example of how well you communicate - in-person this was you describing how a system you were familiar with worked, in a remote environment that might be a prepared presentation or image(s) shared before the call, whatever you are comfortable with
Culture fit - this helps us understand what you would bring to Cronofy and what Cronofy would bring to you, and see if those are aligned to each of our desires
For successful candidates, we will extend an offer conditional on reference and background checks.
At some point throughout this process, if possible, we'd like to meet you in a suitably physically-distanced manner to make at least part of this process 3D.
What we offer
£45,000 - £60,000 dependant on experience
Pension scheme
25 days holiday in addition to national holidays. National holidays are added to your holiday allowance and you're not required to take them on the corresponding day.
Training and personal development days.
A principles driven culture.
Supportive colleagues who enjoy spending time together.

Background
RAL Space is the UK’s national space laboratory and has over 50 years of experience in space programmes with significant involvement in more than 210 instruments on missions to date.
STFC values their employees by offering a benefits package designed to provide an excellent work/life balance including 30 days’ annual leave, 10.5 public and Research Council holidays, flexible working hours, a workplace nursery, exceptional average salary pension scheme, social and sporting activities and societies and a subsidised restaurant.
List of Duties / Responsibilities
We are looking for a software engineer to design, develop and test code for both ground and space based scientific instruments and test equipment.

Product assurance such as change and configuration control.
Working with other engineers and scientists to give an optimum design and solve problems
If you are an experienced engineer then you will also have responsibility for Software Project Management and system engineering, including:
Responsible for large parts of instrument development.
Seeing projects through from specification to implementation.
Generating quotes and technical submissions to prospective customers.
Maintaining a schedule for software activities.
Responsible for system design
Review & approval of technical specifications and documents
Working with other system engineers within RAL Space and the customer.
Shortlisting Criteria
Essential
Degree level or equivalent experience in software engineering.
Programming in ANSI C.
Use of software configuration management tools and defect tracking tools e.g. Git.
Desirable
Use of tool chains and debug tools such as GCC
Use of software standards e.g. ECSS-E-ST-40
Use of programming guidelines e.g. MISRA (S&I)
Knowledge of an ISO9000 or other quality management system

About Us...
Permutive is powering the future of targeted advertising on the Open Web today. As the only Audience Platform built on edge computing, we enable premium advertisers and publishers to plan, build and activate cohorts — all while keeping everyone's data safe.
We're a remote-first B2B SaaS company with 140+ people—centred around our London and New York hubs—and growing rapidly. We have received funding from some of the world's best investors, including a recent $75m Series C led by SoftBank Vision Fund 2.
About the Role...
Permutive is expanding our engineering team further and we are looking for a Scala Engineer to join our Dashboard team and help enable our customers and internal teams to engage with Permutive's fundamental products in a coherent and consistent manner.
You'll use a wide range of technologies to build the functionality that solves previously-impossible problems for our customers and helps them deliver value through our platform. You should be keen to own the process of building new product features and managing the whole development process, including coding, testing, deploying, and monitoring.
The wider context
Permutive is a B2B SaaS company building the data platform and tools for a world with a trillion edge devices. We have product–market fit and customers that love us, and we're 130+ people and growing rapidly in Europe and the US. We have received funding from some of the world's best investors, including Y Combinator.
We're 40+ engineers working to build an outstanding engineering culture so that everyone who joins has the opportunity and the support to do the best work of their life. Small, autonomous teams are important to us, and we want to empower everyone to make—and be accountable for—decisions through ownership.
Everything we build has to scale: our platform handles more requests each day than there are new tweets and Google searches, and each month we see more than a billion users. We think applying functional programming techniques like compositionality and type-safety is the best way to build the type of massive distributed system our platform comprises, allowing us to move fast without sacrificing quality.
Teams and technologies
The Dashboard team are focussed on enabling our customers and internal teams to engage with Permutive's fundamental products in a coherent and consistent manner. We are responsible for the Dashboard, which all of our customers use to interact with our underlying platform and technology. The team owns some of the fundamental concepts that enable these interactions, such as organizations and workspaces, or identity and access management. We collaborate closely with other product engineering teams to expose new features in our Dashboard.
We would love to hear from Software Engineers that have knowledge or an interest in working with some of the technologies we use:
Scala: cats, cats-effect, http4s, circe, doobie, refined
Infrastructure: Kubernetes, Kafka, Postgres, Grafana, Terraform
You will be responsible for helping the team build backend systems that power our Dashboard, finding better ways to interact with systems owned by other teams and building new features that affect the way customers login and engage with the Dashboard.
The ideal candidate will have
Experience working with REST APIs in Scala
Experience collaborating closely with frontend engineers or teams
Able to communicate technical concepts clearly
Have a broad understanding of software engineering concepts
Excellent verbal and written communication skills
We'd be particularly excited if you have one or more of the below

Experience building and deploying microservices, e.g. using Kubernetes
Experience with cloud platforms such as AWS or GCP
Familiarity with functional Scala libraries, e.g. Cats or Doobie
Salary
We take a structured, objective approach to salary-setting, which is based on market information, our compensation strategy, and your experience and capability as assessed through our interview process.
For a typical candidate with strong Scala experience plus most of our requirements we would likely pay £80,000 + options.
For a candidate with a breadth of experience, and who meets several of our bonus criteria, we'd pay up to £100,000 + options.

The Environmental Research and Consultancy Department is the CAA’s environmental centre of excellence. Our primary focus is to support the UK Department for Transport providing technical advice on all aspects of aviation noise, including airport noise modelling and monitoring, noise policy development, and research about the health effects of aircraft noise. We also support industry, community and other government stakeholders in all matters relating to aircraft noise, and increasingly in aviation emissions .

Redgate makes software to help companies and professionals get the most out of their databases. Our products are designed to work for everyone – from the smallest, single developer houses to Fortune 500 companies. We succeed by reliably solving our customers’ problems with ingeniously simple software.

We’re looking for experienced software engineers to join one of our product teams. If you’re passionate about writing great code, love working in a team, and want to shape the software you build, we want to hear from you.

At Redgate, we believe that the best software comes from engaging small teams with clear purpose, freedom to act, and a drive to learn.

Achieving work life balance has never been more important and so Redgate has adopted a flexible-hybrid model. This means that people will work flexibly with a blend of remote (home) and co-located (office) work, with teams having the flexibility to decide which location best suits the outcomes they need to deliver.

Where you work and how frequently you attend the office will depend on the nature of your role, make-up of the team and the type of work that you need to do. A weekly visit to the office is likely for most people to support our collaborative culture and enable our teams to deliver great work, though less frequent visits may also work well. So, if you are able to travel to & from the office safely in a day, that works well for us.

Development at Redgate
You’ll be involved in all stages of software development: from research calls with customers to pushing your code through our automated build system and making those all-important deployments.

Most of our code is written in C# (with a growing number of products using web technologies including TypeScript and React). We use GitHub for source control and TeamCity for continuous integration. Every software engineer gets all the hardware they need (fast machines and multiple monitors are standard), and freedom in choosing the software tools they’re comfortable with.

We take personal development seriously at Redgate. We run frequent lightning talks, open spaces (mini conferences run by Redgate engineers), and a yearly Down Tools Week. We have a healthy budget for attending conferences, and the last three years we’ve even held our own with all sessions run by Redgate employees.

What makes you a Redgate Software Engineer
Excellent skills using a modern object-oriented language – we predominately use C#, but any similar language requires the skillset we’re looking for.
You appreciate making things simple isn’t always easy and strive for simplicity in the code you write and the products you build.
You thrive in a highly collaborative team of software engineers and are enthusiastic about engaging with customers, designers, and product managers as necessary to create great products and services.
(desirable) You have domain expertise in one or more of Redgate’s product areas.
(desirable) You have experience working within an agile development team, with knowledge of practices such as TDD, BDD and continuous delivery.

Package
A great benefits package
You'll work about 40 hours per week, with flexible work time
We dedicate Friday afternoons to personal development, community and innovation
Salary is £45,000 to £50,000 (depending on experience)

At Redgate we recruit on a rolling basis, which means we carry on recruiting until we find the right person for the role. We tend to compare individuals to the role specification rather than to each other.

Redgate is happy to fully fund all charges related to the successful applicant obtaining a Skilled Worker Visa if needed. We also assist with both the financial costs and logistics of your move to the UK."

Making decisions in the modern world is difficult. How can we plan and predict the outcome of new strategies, in an era of globally disruptive events? A new illness might fundamentally change our lives and work; a single grounded ship could affect global supply chains for weeks; fighting climate change will mean fundamental changes to how the world operates.
At Silico, we believe simulation is the key, combining hard data with human knowledge and intuition, enabling foresight in the face of radical uncertainty. We're building a platform which allows people to build models of their world collaboratively, simulating possible futures and optimising for a brighter outcome.
We believe in a transparent, evidence-based approach to decision-making. We want to give people insight into their problems and help them reach reasoned conclusions, with models they can fully understand. We'd love for you to join us to help make this a reality.

Our tech stack consists of:
Rust for main API service, as well as compiler toolchain (compiled to WebAssembly)
Additional Python, Typescript & Golang microservices

What would be your dream job? How about one where you can work remotely and spend your time working with Clojure? How about one where your voice will be heard and you can help shape the tools that are built? If so, this could be the job you’re looking for!
The Role
We are currently expanding our development team and are looking for someone with strong backend Clojure skills. You will be working on our web app and ensuring that we continue to deliver reliable and scalable solutions to our clients.
The app enables clients to interact with the data in their warehouse and schedule the ingestion of data from other sources and carry out transformations on it. We have an ambitious roadmap for 2021, which you will be helping us deliver.
About you
You will have strong backend development skills (extra points if you’re a polyglot), enjoy problem solving and accept that data is routinely ‘dirty’ and that things occasionally break and will need fixing.
We’re looking for someone who has experience of web application development and working with distributed systems. Data engineering and front end experience would also be beneficial.
The work can sometimes be fast paced, especially when we’re approaching the end of a sprint, so a cool head and a can-do attitude is a must.
Our Tech Stack
We love Clojure/Clojurescript and want to use it for everything, so almost all of our backend code is written in Clojure, and we use a mix of CLJS and JS on the front end. We’ve started selecting standard libraries for all of our code to ensure that everything has the same level of functionality and that we’re using the best libraries for the task.
We deploy everything in AWS and make use of a lot of their services, especially RDS, S3, Fargate, ECS and Cloudfront. Recently we started using AWS Code Deploy and Code Pipeline to automate the deployment of our main services and create a CI/CD pipeline, and this is being expanded to automate all deployments.
Github stores all our code repos and everyone in the company uses Slack. There are also various other online services for log management, monitoring and tickets.
About us
kleene.ai is a fast-growing startup that has been operating for almost 4 years and was established with the goal of revolutionising data. We believe that all companies, regardless of size, should be able to easily access and understand their data. Our goal is to provide clients with the ability to access any of their data sources from within a simple interface without any technical knowledge.
This is an exciting time to join us, the number of clients we have is continuing to grow and we’re expecting to increase the dev team further in the coming months.

We can even make sellers chain-free, with our cash advance securing…","Nested is redefining estate agency in the UK. With a combination of groundbreaking technology, innovative finance and expert local agents, Nested is fixing the whole moving experience one problem at a time.
We're a modern agent built for movers, the first estate agent to support both the selling and buying process with everything in between. We can even make sellers chain-free, with our cash advance securing their ideal home before they sell.
We are a wildly ambitious team, backed by Europe’s leading VCs and led by an experienced, hands-on founding team. We're all contributing remotely to build a new era for home movers, with plans to optionally work from home 3 days of the week in the future when we can spend some time in our Farringdon office again. And when work is over, there’s plenty of socialising, from film nights to sports days.
If redefining an entire industry is a challenge that motivates you, come and join the team at Nested.
The product team:
Our team's mission is to create the best tools in the industry. We break that down into two pillars:
We want to build the best customer account for home sellers on Android and iPhone and web, providing visibility into what is traditionally a low-trust, emotionally fraught process and delightful flows to remove friction like constant phone calls.
We want to build the best agency platform: one that gives Nested agents superpowers and allows them to focus on what matters most - providing fantastic customer service.
Requirements:
We are looking for someone who:
Likes to get things done, that merge button is so satisfying.
Is motivated by a great product that makes a difference, solving problems for people through technology.
Is empathetic and good with people, able to manage stakeholders and mentor other engineers.
Is keen to learn.
May have an interest in either management or in being a technical expert one day.
They will:
Spend time with our product managers figuring out what our next great product feature will be.
Deliver features end-to-end, including what to measure, what v1 looks like and what success looks like. We use a process called feature leading to do that.
Use, or learn to use, our tech stack, Elixir, GraphQL and React. We are language agnostic in our hiring. We like to optimise for simplicity, and write code for the next engineer.
Help improve our diversity by contributing to workshops we run. We teach elixir to various groups.
Work at and learn to run a startup. We’ve already helped a few folks chase their own dreams!
On a day-to-day basis they could be:
Having business impact - by leading and contributing to new features as part of a cross-functional team, pairing with other engineers where it makes sense.
Having technical impact - by ensuring our tech estate is not a blocker to our business goals and engaging with cross-team architectural decisions.
Having an impact on your team - by coaching, mentoring, teaching, helping to break down tasks into small manageable chunks, reviewing others’ code, and make sure we’re giving and receiving feedback regularly.
Helping to improve our teams' well-being - for example by organising a social or two.
Helping to improve our brand - for example by blogging, running a work experience day for local school children or mentoring an intern for a few months.
Benefits:
Salary between £70k and £90k per annum based on experience.
Generous options grant with further options awarded at reviews depending on performance.
4% employer pension contribution.
Private health insurance with gym discounts & more.
27 days holiday + bank holidays.
Work From Home 3 days a week, and flexible working hours. (though we are fully remote right now)
£1,000 personal development budget per year.
Generous maternity package, 16 weeks full pay.
Generous paternity package, 4 weeks paternity leave.
Should these packages not suit you, we are happy to discuss alternatives.
Monthly team social events.
Plus, if you’re ever buying or selling a home, we're pretty good at that as well and employees get it at a discount.
Interview process:
Stage 1: A chat with one of our engineering team, where we get to learn more about one another and see if the role is a good fit for both parties.
Stage 2: A live coding session with one of the engineers in the team you'd work in. Partly in a language of your choice, partly in Elixir (we'll send you some learning materials ahead of time so you only have to learn a subset of the language). All on your machine in your most comfortable coding environment. We want to see how you learn and how you perform when comfortable.
Stage 3: Two culture & values fit interviews with Matthew our Head of Product and one other.
We are striving to build a diverse and inclusive team, but we recognise there is always more to be done. In the last year, we’ve focused on running workshops in collaboration with tech bootcamps, promoting self-education through our anti-racism reading list (among other reading lists), sponsoring work visas and building diversity into the engineering growth framework. If you would like to talk to us about these efforts, or have suggestions for how we can do better, we would love to hear from you.
Nested is proud to be an equal opportunities employer: At Nested we embrace diversity and see it as a benefit to our company. That's why we're committed to hiring top talent regardless of race, religion, colour, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, age or status as an individual with a disability.
We’re a growing team and happy to make any accommodations we can for individual needs. If you have an additional accessibility or other requirement we haven’t considered, we will do our best to adapt and make sure your needs are met.

They have since assembled a talented and diverse team of legal, software and machine learning engineers to build the next generation of contracting tools.

Robin AI is an exciting, venture-backed technology startup whose mission is to dramatically re-duce the cost and complexity of legal advice. Backed by top London based VCs, Forward Part-ners and Episode 1, Robin uses a combination of human and artificial intelligence to review and edit contracts and is building software to fundamentally change the legal industry forever.

Robin was established in March 2019 by CEO Richard Robinson (a former City lawyer) and CTO James Clough (a theoretical physicist who works in Machine Learning). They have since assem-bled a talented and diverse team of legal, software and machine learning engineers to build the next generation of contracting tools.

At Robin AI, we create groundbreaking products that are transforming legal teams. Our work is multi-disciplinary and brings together the best talent in engineering, AI and the law. Our current product uses neural networks to read and comprehend written contracts, assesses whether they adhere to our customers’ preferred positions, and then automatically amends them. But our am-bitions go way beyond reviewing contracts – we want to build technology that changes the way companies all over the world do deals.

To do that, we need to build. Specifically, we want to build a new, structured way for businesses to make and agree contracts by replacing the outdated Microsoft Word workflow with a brows-er-based, visual contract building application that will empower anyone to create a world class contract without a lawyer. Just like Figma has democratised design tools, and WebFlow has de-mocratised website development, we want to give business owners, HR teams, procurement teams and in-house lawyers all over the world the ability to create and negotiate any business contract by combining legal, design, software and machine learning expertise.

The Role
You will join a team of passionate Frontend Engineers to contribute to the building and architecting of software that will allow our customers to create contracts from a library of templates, and quickly review and edit contracts sent to them by counterparties. You’ll also help us develop the front end for our machine learning service which can automatically edit contracts and explain the changes to the user in plain English. And you’ll help us build an intelligent contract repository that will help companies save thousands of hours searching for information trapped inside their contracts. We’ve already made great progress towards this product vision, but you will play a pivotal role in making it a reality.
Tech Stack
Our Frontend is built using React and Apollo, and we use Python web frameworks, such as Django and Flask, to implement our backend services, alongside various other libraries such as Celery. Everything runs on AWS services, including but not limited to ECS, Elasticsearch, Lamb-da and SQS. We use CircleCI to build and deploy, and all of our infrastructure is managed using Terraform.

We use some other third party platforms to help us…","About Habitude
Habitude is an early-stage process management and automation platform targeted initially at UK school groups.
Behind the scenes schools are complex organisations where leaders are grappling with complex administration. Processes crawl and are error prone, and oftentimes this spills over into the school and impacts the work that they do for their students.
Across the public sector: in higher education, in local government, in health and social care, the same is true - leadership and management everywhere cite that simplification of process and admin as the thing that they would most like to change about how they operate.
Habitude helps complex and bureaucratic organisations to connect together their people, their platforms and their data to form single-thread processes that are more efficient, fail less often and are easy-to-track.
The platform
Our platform provides an end-to-end solution for disconnected processes via our drag-and-drop workflow builder, a library of third party integrations and automations, and deployment and tracking tools that keep processes moving and visible.
We are taking the bits we love from tools like Zapier, Monday.com and others, and bringing them together in a platform that works for complex organisations that are just beginning their journey with automation and interoperability.
Habitude sits in the space between an organisation's existing platforms and tools - it's not a replacement for them. We often explain to customers that we are their 'plumbing', connecting the work that teams are doing through their everyday tools and platforms into the wider processes that it forms a part of.
The company
Habitude was formed in early 2021 with the support of a group of investors who have built and scaled multiple successful startups between them.
We are now growing our internal team and looking for a full-stack Javascript developer who is excited to help us design the solutions to real problems fast via our lightweight, low-code development ethos.
How are we building Habitude?
Our platform allows customers to build business workflows that connect their people, their existing platforms and their data. Workflows are highly customisable creating a near infinite number of possibilities. Finding simple solutions to this challenge is our goal.
We work on a best-tool-for-the-job philosophy to build solutions quickly and in an easily maintainable way. This sees us combine code, low-code and no-code solutions together in a hybrid approach.
Most of our front-end is facilitated by the Bubble.io IDE, which also does a lot of lifting on core background services, including providing most of our API architecture.
Much of Habitude's core functionality - defining, storing and executing processes - sits within a custom codebase (JavaScript / NodeJS) that plays well with Bubble. We use some other third party platforms to help us with 0Auth 2.0, automated testing and email management.
Who we are looking for
About the role:
We need a JavaScript developer who can use our stack and ethos to build the capabilities that our customers need. You'll get to work across frontend and backend and will help us solve our biggest technical challenges - there are plenty of those to come.
You'll like solving real problems quickly. We aim to get solutions into circulation fast that a) work and are reliable and b) that fit our wider architecture.
You'll get to interface directly with customers to stay close to and really understand the problems that you're solving.
Periodically you will help us to address tech debt and improve the overall architecture. You'll be the person best placed to find opportunities for us to do better with our engineering, or to rethink how we are approaching problems.
We think that low-code and no-code is fantastic - we want you to as well. Prioritising our effort on hard-to-solve problems means that we solve more problems. Low and no-code allows us to deploy our time and resources where it matters. It's fine if you haven't used tools like Bubble before - we will pay for your training to get started.
Your profile & experience:
You should:
Have 1+ years experience working as a JavaScript developer with experience across backend / NodeJS and frontend. A graduate hire would be considered for an exceptional candidate.
Have experience of REST API's and 0Auth 2.0, and are comfortable working with complex JSON objects / payloads.
Have experience in working with UI design briefs to create elegant and responsive frontend experiences - these will typically be built via a low / no-code frontend framework.
Be able to interface with the DOM and have sound knowledge of HTML and CSS.
Ideally you also have:
Come from a Computer Science background at degree level.
Some experience of AWS, GCP and / or Azure and would be comfortable setting up and managing services there.
Experimented with low and no-code environments. Either way, you can see the advantages of hybrid working and will be happy to embrace it.

Gear4music is the largest retailer of musical instruments and equipment in the UK. Launched in 2003, we're a fast-growing company - with sales climbing from £12M to £120M in just a few years. We’re not stopping there, and we need you to help us continue our growth.

Who we really are
We really care about people. We want you to grow with us in an open and supportive environment. We want to hear your ideas and for you to be yourself in an atmosphere that embraces people’s individual personalities.

We pride ourselves on our culture, and try to offer something more meaningful than token beanbags and a PS5 you don’t have time to play. We've got important things covered, like having properly trained mental health first aiders, as well as silly things like our #geese Slack channel. There's plenty to get involved in, from movie nights to a Dungeons & Dragons club.

We’re techy to the core, with technical leaders through to board level. We pride ourselves on our flat structure where directors sit in with the teams and are there when you need them. We encourage open and honest feedback, even if you’re critiquing your boss.

We normally work from our offices in central Manchester, but most people are working remotely at the moment due to Coronavirus. For those that need to get out of the house, we’re set up to let people work in a COVID-secure environment.

Who we’re not
We won't sell you a job based on gimmicks. We know you don’t want to hear how ""unique"" this opportunity is.
We’re not an agency. You can do your best work here, in a team who recognise that quality matters.
We don't ask you to work longer hours than you're paid for. We encourage a healthy work-life balance.

What we do
Gear4music sell musical instruments and equipment online. Offering over 55,000 products from hundreds of manufacturers. We sell to over 190 countries, in 15 languages and 9 currencies, shipping with a range of couriers from multiple hubs in different countries.

Our technology team build and maintain the platform that makes it all possible. You might work on new user-facing website features, our order processing systems, large-scale architecture reworks or integrating new couriers.

Who are you
You're a motivated, flexible and talented engineer who is enthusiastic about learning new things and challenging themselves. We have opportunities for software engineers at every level, from juniors to engineering managers and technical architects.

You believe in a collaborative and friendly work environment that delivers real projects. You take pride in the things you do and like to see things from beginning to end. You will advocate new technologies when it’s right for the business.

You'll get bonus points if you’ve got strong GIF-game, and we’d love to know what you’re passionate about! We want to hear your ideas and for you to tell us what you think.

What we’re looking for
We want to work with people who set high standards for themselves and their work. We’d love it if you were passionate about quality, testing, performance, or documentation (or all of them.)

Some of the things we’re looking for:
Modern PHP development skills.
HTML5, SCSS, JavaScript (including frameworks like ReactJS and ExtJS).
MySQL knowledge, working with large databases.
Cloud computing and containerised applications.
Building scalable distributed systems.
A background in e-commerce.
An interest in software performance.

Great pay, which is never late.
A ‘go home’ culture. No one is expecting you to work longer than your hours.

Help grow the product & engineering team by interviewing candidates, onboarding new hires and…","Send your resume to jobs@lindushealth.com to apply. (Holiday note: We usually respond within 24 hours but are taking a break at the end of December 2021. Expect a response in early January.)
Lindus Health is looking for a Principal Software Engineer to build the platform powering the next generation of clinical trials. We want to add a very experienced engineer to our small team to do hands-on product development, drive long-term architecture and evolve our engineering practices as the team grows.
About us
Clinical trials are in crisis. The industry hasn't changed in 30 years, and the cost of bringing new medicines to market is skyrocketing as a result.
Lindus Health’s mission is to fix this. We accelerate clinical trials, so patients can benefit. We’re building the world’s first full stack clinical trial platform, to conduct faster, safer clinical trials on behalf of companies developing new treatments, and lowering the barriers to participation for patients.
Since launching the company in March 2021 we have helped find over 5,000 patients for more than 25 clinical trials in areas like type 2 diabetes, COVID-19 diagnostics and mental health. We closed a $5m seed round to grow our platform and team.

About you
You have at least 7 years of experience as a software engineer. This includes at least 1 year in a role that could be characterized as “senior+” - a role where you acted as a tech lead for a project with multiple engineers or where you demonstrated impact across multiple teams or functions.
You are comfortable working across a stack that includes frontend (TypeScript/React), backend (Python/Django/Postgres) and infrastructure (AWS). You don’t necessarily have hands-on experience with all pieces of our stack but are happy to pick up technology that’s new to you.
You are product-minded: you want to understand why we are building something to figure out the best how in collaboration with product managers, trial managers and users. You like to iterate on features based on user feedback.
You are an excellent listener and communicator who can build consensus, drive decisions and resolve conflicts. You write clearly and know when to deploy written artifacts to move teams and projects along.
You like an early-stage startup environment where you have lots of autonomy and opportunities to grow your skills. You want to have a major impact on architecture and engineering practices as we grow from a small team to a large organization.
You belong here! If your experience and interests match with some of the above, we want you to apply.
Why join the Lindus Health team?
Be part of the founding team on a mission to change the way healthcare operates!
£80K - 95K base salary, plus 0.3 - 0.5% equity in stock options
Unlimited holidays; everyone is encouraged to take at least 28 days off each year
Flexible office arrangement; come into the office in London as often as you like, or work remotely within the UK
If working mostly remotely: regular all-expenses paid trips to London to see the whole team (pandemic permitting)
Monthly team events and days out, recently we've been to Legoland, and a Millwall FC home game (decided by popular vote)
Up to £500 towards setting up your home office
A new laptop as your main workstation
UK visa sponsorship if you’re not already eligible to work in the UK
What you will do
In your first month:
Learn about clinical trials and the problems we are trying to solve from our co-founders, medical lead and trial managers
Get your development environment set up, figure out a starter project with the team, make your first commits and your first deploys
Start participating in the regular product development cycle with the product & engineering team
Within your first year:
Collaborate with our trial partners and users to iterate on features they are using as well as to discover and ship new features
Take on technical leadership for a major product area and work with co-founders & product managers to set the product direction
Facilitate long-term architecture and design decisions with the whole engineering team
Evolve engineering practices and work on making the team more productive in areas such as testing, CI, deployment pipelines, cloud infrastructure
Help grow the product & engineering team by interviewing candidates, onboarding new hires and mentoring other engineers
Our technology strategy
Collaboration rocks. We like processes that emphasize openness and knowledge sharing across disciplines, across hierarchies and across time. We acknowledge that sharing, discussing and documenting their work means a certain amount of overhead for individuals, but this is more than offset in the long run by a culture of healthy teams and individual growth.
Iterate with abandon. We recognize that we often don’t know what the heck we’re doing when we start working on a new feature or technical problem, but we know that our understanding will improve as we start down a path to a particular solution. We favor tools and processes that support rapid iteration and frequent validation through user feedback and metrics.
Favor boring technology. We choose languages, frameworks, libraries, architectures and tools that are well-established in order to focus on the part that's hard and exciting and accelerates clinical trials the most: product development. We like a mature technology that has been around for at least a decade with abundant documentation and a large community around it. We deviate from this norm in targeted areas of innovation relevant to the business.
Related reading: Boring Technology (Dan McKinley), Buy vs build (Camille Fournier)
Test in production. We recognize that the last steps of integration and productionization of a new feature are hard - often harder than writing the code in the first place. We favor tools and processes that let us deploy to production early and often and as confidently as possible. We believe that deep insight into how their code behaves with real data and real users is crucial for engineers to get better at their craft.

Our hiring process for engineers
Send your resume to jobs@lindushealth.com. We welcome all applicants regardless of gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, religion, civil or family status, age, disability, or race. If Lindus Health’s mission resonates with you, we want you to apply! We commit to responding to you within 24 hours (weekends and holidays excepted).
Initial call with a co-founder (30 minutes): This is your opportunity to learn more about Lindus Health. We want to tell you about our mission and what we're doing to revolutionise health research.
Technical discussion with Nik, our CTO and a co-founder (90 minutes): This is a session in two parts where we figure out whether your technical skills mesh with our team. We deliberately don’t demand you write code or solve algorithm puzzles in real time, though you have the option to do a coding challenge at your own pace if you like.
Part 1: Code. You can choose between talking about a piece of code you’ve already written or complete a coding challenge at home that we then talk about. In the first option, you share a piece of your code that you think is interesting. We will walk through the code together and discuss your thought process, challenges you’ve faced and potential refactorings. If you choose the second option you get instructions for a coding challenge that you can do at your own pace ahead of the discussion. The challenge is designed to take no more than 2 hours to complete.
Part 2: Architecture & practices. We will share a document with you in advance that explains our team’s current architecture choices and practices. We will discuss what appeals to you about it, what you would change and what you would add to it. As a principal you would be expected to help evolve our architecture and practices.
Systems design & writing assignment (up to 2 hours): We will ask you to write a design document for a system given some basic requirements. You do this at your own pace at home.
Values interview (45 minutes): This is a conversation with 1 or 2 co-founders about our values and culture and also your chance to ask any questions you still have about Lindus Health.
Meeting the team (one or two calls of 30 mins, or an in-person meeting if you’re in London): At this stage you’ll want to get to know more of the people you’ll be working with. We’ll set up informal calls or meet you in person at our office near Victoria station in London.
Offer! If you've come this far, receive an offer and join the team to help us bring about the next generation of healthcare research. We move fast and usually make a decision within hours of your last meeting."

Are you a backend engineer with strong Ruby and PostgreSQL experience, at scale?
Are you looking to help build a product that aims to make the world a slightly better place?
Do you want to work with a very experienced team who love what they're doing?
Read on, this might be for you.
Intro
We created Peanut with the idea that no woman should have to navigate motherhood without a support network.
Our mission is to provide a safe space for all women to form new friendships, find their communities, and provide support to each other.
Unlike other social networks, we put safety and wellbeing first.

Since 2017, over 1 million women have joined. We've grown quickly across the US and other countries, and received numerous accolades from Apple, the New York Times, Good Morning America, and the BBC to name a few.

We're a multidisciplinary, distributed, diverse, and experienced team of 25 people. Some of us have previously worked with Skyscanner, Citymapper, Deliveroo, Twitter, Pinterest, or Bumble.
We're passionate about creating a great product that actually does social good.
We thrive on collaboration.
We experiment and discover solutions to problems we don't believe anyone has solved well.
Our work ethic
We believe that great teams build great products — and we live to high standards we've learned through past experiences.

Collaboration. No one person can come up with a perfect solution, be it about technology or user experience. We strive to listen to everyone and co-design the product across engineering, design, and beyond.

Trust. We trust each other to do their best and to know how to execute within their role and beyond. So we never micromanage — instead, we agree on scope and let each team member be responsible for execution … and expect everyone to ask for (and get) support when they need it.

Mastery. We care about quality and detail, because we care about our audience. We push ourselves and question our assumptions. We always experiment and keep learning, individually and as a team.

Ambition. We have a bold mission, and we aim to make a dent into what we see as a problem in society. We're committed to the health of our users, our team, and our company.
Feel free to ask us more about how we work!
Your team
The Backend team is responsible for designing, building, testing, and operating software that runs on servers — serving APIs to our user's mobile apps.
It is also responsible for content moderation tools, data processing, and machine learning.

Our main product work happens inside cross-disciplinary teams, that we call squads. Those are formed ad-hoc (on a per-project basis) so that we don't silo anyone into a specific part of the product or software areas.

On top of this, each team member spends every 4th or 5th week tackling smaller projects, ranging from support issues to bug fixing, maintenance, or performance work. We keep our technical debt low on an ongoing basis.

We make pragmatic choices when picking tools. We communicate mostly through Slack and manage work and prioritisation with Monday, review code through Github pull requests, and meet with Whereby or Google Meet.

We have few meetings: a short, daily standup, a weekly town hall meeting to discuss product and/or analytics, plus ad hoc squad meetings as required during a given squad project.
Your role
On a day-to-day basis, your work will be a combination of:

Implement features.
Given high-level requirements discussed with your current squad, you're responsible for modelling and implementation, through to testing, delivery and maintenance of individual features.

Support others.
Within Engineering, this means contributing to code reviews, as well as co-designing APIs or data models with others — whether or not they are in your current squad. Within the Product organisation, you may be called to assess technical feasibility and difficulty of upcoming projects.

Continuously improve code and operations.
You'll keep your eyes peeled for areas of technical debt to fix, performance or scalability issues, production bugs, and plan work to address these with the Backend team.

Share your ideas.
You'll participate in ideation workshops, as well as be expected to submit ideas for new features, be they technical or user-facing. Everyone contributes to the product because we'd never want to miss out on good ideas.

About you
This role might be for you if:

You want to build technology for good.
You feel that our work ethic resonates with yours, and you see how they can act as guidance for your day-to-day work.
You have 5+ years of backend engineering experience, including 3+ years with Ruby on Rails.
You can work with relational databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL) with large and complex datasets (100s of tables, 100s of millions of records).
You have strong computer science fundamentals, from data structures to algorithmic complexity.
You have built software that scales to many concurrent users.
You have worked in a startup environment.
You have worked remotely, and/or with a distributed team.
You are fluent in written and spoken English.
Benefits
Competitive compensation. Your package will vary based on your skill and location.
If you live in the UK, your gross salary will be between 75,000 GBP and 95,000 GBP per year.
If you live in continental Europe, your compensation will be between 90,000 EUR and 120,000 EUR (or local currency).

Work anywhere. We care about the work done, not where you do it from. Most of us work remotely full time, and we're equally happy if you'd prefer to work from our London HQ or anywhere in Europe. You just need a suitable workspace and a good internet connection.
(Note that we do not currently consider candidates living outside the UK or the EU)

Flexible schedule. Many of us are parents and/or have various personal life commitments. While we typically work around 40 hours a week, how you schedule your work hours is up to you.

Travel to meet the team (post-pandemic!)
We know from experience that face time matters in distributed teams. Every 2 months, we gather the team for 3 to 4 days somewhere in Europe, and use that time to run workshops and socialise.
Hiring process
Still reading, but not entirely sure the role is a good fit for you? That's okay! We're happy to consider you. Here's what the process looks like:

Submit your application using the link below. This includes a resume and answers to a few practical questions. No cover letter is needed, although a few words are appreciated.
Application screening. We read every application to understand your motivation, skills, and experience. Once your application has been screened, you'll receive a response whether the outcome is in your favour or not.
Interview with one of our engineers.
Technical interview with a backend engineer. We'll ask you to complete a small programming task ahead of the interview.
Interview with Michelle (Founder and CEO) and one of our product managers or designers.
Our commitment
We’re building a product for people who have been traditionally underserved, and we’re committed to hiring people with different backgrounds and experiences. It helps us build a better product, make better decisions, and better help our users.

We’re committed to building a workforce that’s as diverse as the community of users who love Peanut! So, we welcome everyone to our team.

The role
We are looking for our first platform engineer. You will work closely with all of our cross-functional teams to design, develop and iterate on our shared engineer tools and frameworks, providing capabilities across a number of areas, including monitoring and observability, incident management, disaster recovery, infrastructure, security, and CI/CD. You will be a multiplier for the entire engineering team, championing best practices and aiding in delivering highly available, performant systems.
We are growing our platform 10x in the next year and so you will focus your time on improving our core platform infrastructure to enable us to offer our services to more clients as well as scale up our tech team. We are constantly looking at improving our processes, architectures and technologies, as we continue to grow and face new challenges. You will have plenty of opportunities to help drive technical decisions.
Our core stack is Typescript based and is running on AWS, mostly in Lambda functions. We use Terraform and the Serverless Framework to provision mostly managed services into our event-driven architecture.

What you'll be getting up to:
Work with the rest of the team to improve the developer experience and efficiency.
You will help manage technical standards and processes within teams as well as collaborating with tech leads to align across the engineering organisation.
Improve monitoring and observability.
Implement Infrastructure as Code.
Provide better metrics retention and availability.
Adjust CI/CD tooling and build processes tailored for rapid delivery.
Oversee application security.
Provide mentoring and support to other engineers.
✅This role will be a great fit if
You are comfortable working with AWS.
You are a keen learner and regularly share your learnings with others.
You contribute to the wider tech community or would like to in the future.
You are interested in ""serverless"" cloud services.
You are interested in developer experience and making others more productive.
Through our hiring process, we want people to give examples of the outcomes they've achieved rather than focussing on output. What? How? Why? Tell us more about your thinking process and the results you did, or didn't, deliver.
Research shows that some people are less likely to apply for a role unless they are 100% qualified. Your experience, skills and passion will set you apart so tell us about your achievements, irrespective of whether they are personal or work-related, tell us about your journey, and about what you learnt.
So, if this role excites you, don't let our role description hold you back, get applying!

Hiring Process
Initial screening (30mins video call)
Task Interview (1 hour video call)
Capabilities Interview (1 hour video call)
Values Interview (1 hour video call)
Support - If you have a medical condition or an individual need for an adjustment to our process, and you believe this may affect your ability to be at your best - please let us know so we can talk about how we can best support you and make any adjustments that may be needed.

Our Values

We look for people who share our values and can add to our culture. Values are shared beliefs that guide our decision-making, culture is how we function as a group and how we live our values as individuals.
Be your authentic self: This means finding the intersection between what you love and what you’re good at, so you can be yourself at work.
Set the destination, own the journey: ""Be the change you want to see in the world."" Think big, speak up, take ownership. We believe in learning by experimenting and failing fast: use your creativity and resourcefulness to find solutions to problems you encounter.
Invite everyone to dance: “Diversity is being invited to the party, inclusion is being asked to dance.” We look for people who share our values and contribute to our culture. Diversity alone is not enough. We believe by being diverse and inclusive we make better decisions.
Practice heartfelt, radical candor: We know seeking radically candid feedback can be hugely powerful. We proactively seek and give feedback to reveal blindspots and accelerate growth.

Location:
Bristol or London office affiliation
HR Director, Victoria James • 02 September 2021
We are looking for Frontend Software Engineers to come and help us deliver award-winning work for some great clients including the Royal Navy, Honda, Orange, Versus Arthritis and more.
We’ve got loads of interesting work coming up, including greenfield cutting-edge front end tech projects – we’re really excited about it, and if you’re a frontend engineer looking for a new challenge, this could be for you!
The work
The team are actively using exciting frontend tech, including the likes of:
Jamstack
React
Gatsby
XState
Headless CMS
Web animations
Here are some examples of the kind of things we’ve built in the team:
A completely greenfield progressive web app to revolutionise how Royal Navy personnel get information and get things done - built with Gatsby.js & React, GraphQL and a headless CMS
A secure ship-to-ship, ultra-low bandwidth communications system for the Royal Navy - built with Web Socket technology and REST APIs
An MVP Arabic website for Aston Villa FC – built with Gatsby.js & React
A multi-region online motorbike configurator engine for Honda – built with React & XState
We’ve also got plans in terms of deploying tech like WebGL and we keep an eye on any new, relevant technology that comes along. You will have the opportunity to keep learning, stay on top of new trends, and build interesting things in a fast-paced environment alongside very smart colleagues and a lovely client.
Required skills
You will need to be a great frontend engineer, and we’d expect you to be leading by example when it comes to software engineering best practice. We’re looking for someone who can lead a project from a frontend perspective and influence both other members of the engineering team, the wider experience team and our clients to make sure we’re delivering scalable, high-quality solutions.
You’ll need:
Experience with modern front-end tech including SPA frameworks and API integration
To be a fast learner
To be both a creative and logical thinker
To be passionate about the quality of the end product
To have an enthusiastic, positive, calm and professional approach
To be proactive and show initiative
To have good awareness of industry trends, best practices and standards
To be able to adapt at the pace of an agency
To have excellent time management skills
Some of the tech we’ve mentioned is quite specific – XState for example. If you don’t have experience with some of them, don’t let that put you off applying – but we would expect you to have looked up anything you’ve not heard of before an interview so we can get your take on it.
Interview process
Very straightforward. And friendly. Not designed to catch you out – very much designed to make sure you’re the right fit for us and we’re the right fit for you.
We’ll have an initial chat to make sure you’ve got all the information you need on the role, and on Great State generally, and to answer any questions you might have. We’ll ask you to talk through your (relevant) experience briefly – but no tricky questions.


The second stage is a more detailed run-through of your experience with a couple of members of our software engineering team. We don’t plan out a list of questions in advance, we’ll see where the conversation takes us. Be prepared to talk through what you’ve done and how you did it. And feel free to ask more questions of us (we like people who ask questions).
The third stage is a technical exercise, tailored to the role and your experience. It’s designed to not take up too much of your free time, but it’s important that we can see how you approach problems from a technical point of view. We might ask you to talk us through how you did it in more detail, we might not.

That’s it. Three stages, some interesting conversations, and then with any luck – a job offer and high fives all round.
Benefits
We offer all the usual fun benefits associated with a digital agency plus flexible working hours, the ability to work from home and 27 days holiday, plus bank holidays."

About RedCloud
Open Commerce, RedCloud, and a $31TN race to market
Our mission is to grow global online commerce for the world’s small businesses by removing the barriers to online trading for hundreds of millions of independent retailers and their suppliers across the world’s supply chains. Despite the growth in e-commerce, less than 3% of B2B trading is made online, and yet, FMCG is Largest Product Category in the world - this is a $30tn business in emerging markets with over 1 million manufacturers, 20m distributors and wholesalers and finally over 500m independent retailers, who are the vital route to market serving over 7bn people every day.
When we ask independent retailers why they don’t trade online with FMCG brands, “we don’t know where to even start” is one of the top reasons we hear. That’s because selling, buying, and paying across B2B supply chains is long, complicated, and fragmented; Payments and purchasing are deeply manual, independent retailers have limited visibility on new products and sales opportunities, and FMCG’s (particularly up and coming brands) find it very difficult to reach new retailers and distributors and set up a rapid go to market. Due to antiquated payments networks, and the high cost of payment processing, over 19tn of trade payments are made offline, adding an enormous burden to online trading, with a 500m+ stores that function every day as powerful outlets for consumer brands, directly influence >80% of local consumer buying behaviour but they are often the least technically equipped with data, pricing, or the latest inventory.
The rapidly growing number of new brands, the rise of the middle-class consumer, and the growth in entrepreneurship has driven the need for a new kind of commerce dynamic, accessing key payment and sales points to enable FMCG’S, Distributors and sellers to trade smarter. So we built an Open Commerce Platform that enables the sale and distribution of FMCG products to be made much simpler. Products should be in front of sellers fast, in real-time, through an immersive commerce experience, with trade buyers and sellers able to see live commerce opportunities and pricing. We have built a digital ecosystem that is specifically designed to unlock the full value of the distribution network, providing real-time visibility for order and inventory management. Our innovative platform provides brands and distributors with deep data insights into buyer trends and behaviour and helps identify opportunities for upselling and cross-selling products.

Well, that’s what this job is like, except it won’t end with your face melting or propellers slicing your head off (hopefully).
We’re a small, friendly and collaborative bunch. It’s your typical small office business really. A few rows of desks and laptops. Some bean bags and a table tennis table. And some sweets on reception.
We have a great plan for zapping inefficiency and wastage in an old-school industry. It’s not glamorous. It’s not Biotech or Fintech. (We’ll think of a cool term right after we sort those sweets.) But it is leading-edge stuff in the business intelligence, analytics and market insight space. And if you have a strong sense of community so much the better.
We’re not looking for newbies. You’re a raw, hungry developer who wants to be trained and nurtured? Good luck – but sorry, see ya. We need a senior developer who can hit the ground running and deliver from day one.
You won’t find any prima donnas here. Our world is full of deadlines that must be met. Stop press is simply not an option. Stress levels inevitably rise as these deadlines approach so you’ll need to be comfortable working under pressure and adept at keeping those plates spinning.
Must-have exposure? Vue.js, PHP (Laravel). For you, software isn’t a job, it’s a craft. You’ve got a GitHub repository. You’re involved in meetups, forums etc. You own a hat and a whip (optional).
Culture is as important to us as it is to you. If you thrive in client-facing environments, enjoy interacting with both technical and non-technical audiences and love nothing more than taking an idea from mere concept to actual implementation then you’ll fit right in.
We’re evolving, pivoting quickly, chucking out stuff that doesn’t work. We’re surrounded by coffee shops so we’ll be brainstorming in those.
And the £££ isn’t your usual startup peanuts. We are looking at up to £95,000 plus benefits.
Interested to know more? get that CV and covering letter to us. No covering letter, no good. And don’t look at the Ark!

Ever thought about writing code for racing yachts or cutting-edge medical devices? Dreamt of working on globally recognised, award-winning products? Or wished you worked just minutes from the beach?
At Bluefruit, that’s what we do.
Recognised worldwide for the quality of our code and our Agile practices, clients come to us for reliable, innovative solutions. And with the current explosive growth in the embedded and IoT industry, demand for our services gets bigger every day. That’s why we’re looking for outstanding software engineers to join our teams across a number of exciting new projects.
About you
We’re looking for passionate, open-minded programmers of all experience levels — and you’re looking for technically-challenging software projects and a workplace full of intelligent, friendly people.
You have C or C++ programming skills, can debug faults and use version control. You are familiar with Agile software development practices, such as TDD, BDD, pair programming, sprints, or user stories. It would be great if you also have recent industry experience.
If you are interested in applying for a senior position, we would also be looking for you to have specific technical expertise. For example, your expertise may be embedded microcontrollers, AI, or User Interface development, and so on. Plus, you would be expected to have the ability to coach more junior team members and be able to take the lead on delivering projects.
To be part of Bluefruit, you should demonstrate that you are a keen problem solver, you enjoy working to a very high standard, communicate effectively, and want to work as part of a high-performing team.
Formal academic qualifications aren’t required, but your programming skills should be second to none. For our senior positions, experience of embedded systems (working with PIC, ARM or AVR architectures, for example) is a big plus.
…and us
At Bluefruit, we don’t just talk about work/life balance – we actively encourage it. From flexible working hours, to letting our people create their own working environment, we work hard to ensure everyone here enjoys coming into work.
We are committed to providing training for everyone in the company to realise their potential. Our company was created by engineers for engineers and, as an EOT company, it’s important to us that all our people have a say in how we develop our business.
Our culture is built around an unerring focus on delivering high-quality code for intelligent products that users love and clients value. We encourage efficient and open communication, and shared responsibility for design and implementation. And we review each other’s work all the time – everyone at Bluefruit constantly seeks out opportunities to learn and improve.
We’re privileged to live in one of the most beautiful parts of the UK – and we all want time to enjoy it, so we focus on flexi-time, not overtime. We also offer a range of benefits, including:
EOT profit-related bonus – tax-free up to £3,600 per year

Well, that’s what this job is like, except it won’t end with your face melting or propellers slicing your head off (hopefully).
We’re a small, friendly and collaborative bunch. It’s your typical small office business really. A few rows of desks and laptops. Some bean bags and a table tennis table. And some sweets on reception.
We have a great plan for zapping inefficiency and wastage in an old-school industry. It’s not glamorous. It’s not Biotech or Fintech. (We’ll think of a cool term right after we sort those sweets.) But it is leading-edge stuff in the business intelligence, analytics and market insight space. And if you have a strong sense of community so much the better.
We’re not looking for newbies. You’re a raw, hungry developer who wants to be trained and nurtured? Good luck – but sorry, see ya. We need a senior developer who can hit the ground running and deliver from day one.
You won’t find any prima donnas here. Our world is full of deadlines that must be met. Stop press is simply not an option. Stress levels inevitably rise as these deadlines approach so you’ll need to be comfortable working under pressure and adept at keeping those plates spinning.
Must-have exposure? Vue.js, PHP (Laravel). For you, software isn’t a job, it’s a craft. You’ve got a GitHub repository. You’re involved in meetups, forums etc. You own a hat and a whip (optional).
Culture is as important to us as it is to you. If you thrive in client-facing environments, enjoy interacting with both technical and non-technical audiences and love nothing more than taking an idea from mere concept to actual implementation then you’ll fit right in.
We’re evolving, pivoting quickly, chucking out stuff that doesn’t work. We’re surrounded by coffee shops so we’ll be brainstorming in those.
And the £££ isn’t your usual startup peanuts. We are looking at up to £65,000 plus benefits.

We are looking to expand our digital team to help develop our applications. You’ll be working with a diverse team of developers, designers, strategic thinkers and passionate people. You’ll get the chance to shape the development paths of the applications and be part of a great team, as well as getting the chance to meet and work with client teams.
About you:
We are looking for problem solvers, not just people who know how to write code. You need to be able to deconstruct large customer journeys and user requirements, into smaller user story led component style architectures working towards overall clean, scalable architectures.
You should have a good understanding of API design and third-party API consumption methodologies, as well as a good understanding of optimisation and performance improvement techniques.

Knowing how the JavaScript ecosystems are evolving is key so you know what technologies to apply to any given set of requirements.
Ideally you should have consultancy experience, be comfortable liaising and leading client discussions as well as communicating well across internal teams.
Managing GCP services and understanding Firebase are a bonus though solid experience of microservices and distributed systems would suffice.
As Full Stack Developer, you will be:
Developing and maintaining all server-side network components.
Ensuring optimal performance of databases and responsiveness to front-end requests.
Collaborating with front-end developers on the integration of elements.
Designing back-end services for various business processes.
Developing high-performance applications by writing testable, reusable, and efficient code.
Implementing effective security protocols, data protection measures, and storage solutions.
Running diagnostic tests, repairing defects, and providing technical support.
Recommending and implementing improvements to processes and technologies.
Keeping informed of advancements in the field of Node.js development.
The ideal Full Stack Developer will have:
At least three years' experience as a Node.js developer.
Extensive knowledge of JavaScript and MongoDB.
Track record of building well defined and scalable RESTful APIs.
Can demonstrate sound security principles and scalable security API design.
Knowledge of front-end web technologies (we use Vue).
A good understanding of GCP or AWS including deployment methodologies.
Solid understanding of Firebase including Firestore, Firebase Auth and Firebase Functions.
Micro service architecture build and deployment experience.
Why come and work with us
If you're looking for a role that is out of the ordinary, this is the place to come.
As part of a team that works on exciting projects, with some of the world’s premier brands, you will have the opportunity to develop your career path, work with creatives and help shape the direction of our digital team.
Benefits include:
Flexible working at home and in the office.
25 days holiday.

Free tea, coffee and fruit in the office.

About RedCloud
Open Commerce, RedCloud, and a $31TN race to market
Our mission is to grow global online commerce for the world’s small businesses by removing the barriers to online trading for hundreds of millions of independent retailers and their suppliers across the world’s supply chains. Despite the growth in e-commerce, less than 3% of B2B trading is made online, and yet, FMCG is Largest Product Category in the world - this is a $30tn business in emerging markets with over 1 million manufacturers, 20m distributors and wholesalers and finally over 500m independent retailers, who are the vital route to market serving over 7bn people every day.
When we ask independent retailers why they don’t trade online with FMCG brands, “we don’t know where to even start” is one of the top reasons we hear. That’s because selling, buying, and paying across B2B supply chains is long, complicated, and fragmented; Payments and purchasing are deeply manual, independent retailers have limited visibility on new products and sales opportunities, and FMCG’s (particularly up and coming brands) find it very difficult to reach new retailers and distributors and set up a rapid go to market. Due to antiquated payments networks, and the high cost of payment processing, over 19tn of trade payments are made offline, adding an enormous burden to online trading, with a 500m+ stores that function every day as powerful outlets for consumer brands, directly influence >80% of local consumer buying behaviour but they are often the least technically equipped with data, pricing, or the latest inventory.
The rapidly growing number of new brands, the rise of the middle-class consumer, and the growth in entrepreneurship has driven the need for a new kind of commerce dynamic, accessing key payment and sales points to enable FMCG’S, Distributors and sellers to trade smarter. So we built an Open Commerce Platform that enables the sale and distribution of FMCG products to be made much simpler. Products should be in front of sellers fast, in real-time, through an immersive commerce experience, with trade buyers and sellers able to see live commerce opportunities and pricing. We have built a digital ecosystem that is specifically designed to unlock the full value of the distribution network, providing real-time visibility for order and inventory management. Our innovative platform provides brands and distributors with deep data insights into buyer trends and behaviour and helps identify opportunities for upselling and cross-selling products.
What you will be doing
· Hands-on coding with C#.NET
· Work closely with all development, product and service delivery teams using the Agile method
· Build platform integrations with external customers and suppliers
· Mentor your team (including pair programming) for live and future projects
· Share and implement ideas for system improvements and changes

Developing high-performance applications by writing testable, reusable, and efficient code.
Implementing effective security protocols, data protection measures, and storage solutions.

At least three years' experience as a Node.js developer.
Extensive knowledge of JavaScript and MongoDB.

We are currently looking for an experienced developer with strong PHP experience.
Your initial role will be implementing a total re-brand of our Virtual Learning Environments (VLE). You will take our design ideas, and create a bespoke theme to re-design the front end of the VLE. You will add value to the initial designs with your own suggestions to further enhance the learning experience.

Alongside this continuous improvement, you be responsible for overseeing the management of the VLE - ensuring the open-source code is updated as necessary, backups function correctly, and performance remains optimum; this will also be a combination of personal input and overseeing our contractors.
There are various other IT tasks that you would be expected to assist with where possible and where skills permit, such as website improvements, internal IT management, IT project management.

Our Stack
We were an early adopter of the .NET platform, kicking the tyres since the very first beta some 20 years ago! and we use it, and web technologies to great effect. We deliver a suite of Desktop, Server, Web, and Hybrid Cloud software; all with an API that our customers, resellers, and partners can use to extend the software to encompass situations beyond what we had envisioned!
We are always looking at new technology and trying to stay ahead of the curve. Our principal technology stack is based on .NET Framework 4.8, but with the recent release of .NET 6 we are very excited to transition and unlock a new wave of capability for the future.
We have a mix of languages in place.

However, over time, and especially since C# has caught up at interoperation, we also have significant C# usage, and C# is our focus for the future of our back-end stack.
On the front-end, our language of choice is TypeScript; we are huge fans of type safety as an aide to building robust, scalable software, with the ability to fearlessly refactor.

Well, that’s what this job is like, except it won’t end with your face melting or propellers slicing your head off (hopefully).
We’re a small, friendly and collaborative bunch. It’s your typical small office business really. A few rows of desks and laptops. Some bean bags and a table tennis table. And some sweets on reception.
We have a great plan for zapping inefficiency and wastage in an old-school industry. It’s not glamorous. It’s not Biotech or Fintech. (We’ll think of a cool term right after we sort those sweets.) But it is leading-edge stuff in the business intelligence, analytics and market insight space. And if you have a strong sense of community so much the better.
We’re not looking for newbies. You’re a raw, hungry developer who wants to be trained and nurtured? Good luck – but sorry, see ya. We need a senior developer who can hit the ground running and deliver from day one.
You won’t find any prima donnas here. Our world is full of deadlines that must be met. Stop press is simply not an option. Stress levels inevitably rise as these deadlines approach so you’ll need to be comfortable working under pressure and adept at keeping those plates spinning.
Must-have exposure? Vue.js, PHP (Laravel). For you, software isn’t a job, it’s a craft. You’ve got a GitHub repository. You’re involved in meetups, forums etc. You own a hat and a whip (optional).
Culture is as important to us as it is to you. If you thrive in client-facing environments, enjoy interacting with both technical and non-technical audiences and love nothing more than taking an idea from mere concept to actual implementation then you’ll fit right in.
We’re evolving, pivoting quickly, chucking out stuff that doesn’t work. We’re surrounded by coffee shops so we’ll be brainstorming in those.

DriveWorks is a UK headquartered, award-winning software company with global sales through our resellers. Our company is built on innovative technology, high standards, market insight, sharing knowledge and a vibrant mix of talent.
Our Design Automation & Product Configurator software enables businesses around the world to design, personalize, and sell custom products in a highly visual and engaging way, including live, online 3D visualization.
Companies are embracing digital technologies and our software is key to helping manufacturers move forward. With increased demand from the industry, and funding from BGF, we’re growing rapidly, investing in our people and resources – it’s a great time to join us!
We are a forward-thinking, growing business. Our people are at the heart of everything we do and our offices are inspiring places to be. We’re committed to supporting our teams with the training, tools, and knowledge they need to build incredible solutions, driven by innovation and customer feedback.
We
Are a small team of highly-talented .NET developers creating software our users around the world *love* to use, to realize huge gains inside of our customers’ businesses.
Get excited by delivering new features and improvements that put new capabilities in the hands of our users and reduce friction in their daily lives.
Are perpetually curious about software development and how we can improve what we do.
Are big believers in an agile approach to software development.
Are looking to expand our team to tackle even bigger challenges as we grow the company.
Work in beautiful surroundings in converted barns with modern facilities in Thelwall, Warrington.
Can’t wait to meet you!
You
Are an experienced and highly engaged developer who cares deeply about delivering robust software that excites and delights users.
Stay abreast of the latest technologies and developments and think about how it can be applied to improve the lives of both our teams and our customers.
Enjoy working with other developers whether mentoring those who are just embarking on their development career and need guidance and mentorship, or working with peers to drive the product forward.
Enjoy the prospect of working with the wider team to help guide product direction and support our users, in particular our colleagues in Sales and Support.
Can see some of our software in action at https://driveworkslive.com/
Our Stack
We were an early adopter of the .NET platform, kicking the tyres since the very first beta some 20 years ago! and we use it, and web technologies to great effect. We deliver a suite of Desktop, Server, Web, and Hybrid Cloud software; all with an API that our customers, resellers, and partners can use to extend the software to encompass situations beyond what we had envisioned!
We are always looking at new technology and trying to stay ahead of the curve. Our principal technology stack is based on .NET Framework 4.8, but with the recent release of .NET 6 we are very excited to transition and unlock a new wave of capability for the future.
We have a mix of languages in place. As a heavy automator of other software including the SOLIDWORKS CAD software and Microsoft Office, a significant part of the original code base is written in Visual Basic .NET which has served us very well over the years. However, over time, and especially since C# has caught up at interoperation, we also have significant C# usage, and C# is our focus for the future of our back-end stack.
On the front-end, our language of choice is TypeScript; we are huge fans of type safety as an aide to building robust, scalable software, with the ability to fearlessly refactor.
Location
Whilst we are in the main an office-based team, there is opportunity to work from home as a hybrid role. We work in modern offices in converted barns in Thelwall, Warrington with easy access to the M56, M62 and the M6, and plenty of free on-site parking.
Our offices are a warm and welcoming environment with the latest technology and equipment, a pool table, a beer fridge, secret chocolate treats and a great team of enthusiastic people.

Well, that’s what this job is like, except it won’t end with your face melting or propellers slicing your head off (hopefully).
We’re a small, friendly and collaborative bunch. It’s your typical small office business really. A few rows of desks and laptops. Some bean bags and a table tennis table. And some sweets on reception.
We have a great plan for zapping inefficiency and wastage in an old-school industry. It’s not glamorous. It’s not Biotech or Fintech. (We’ll think of a cool term right after we sort those sweets.) But it is leading-edge stuff in the business intelligence, analytics and market insight space. And if you have a strong sense of community so much the better.
We’re not looking for newbies. You’re a raw, hungry developer who wants to be trained and nurtured? Good luck – but sorry, see ya. We need a senior developer who can hit the ground running and deliver from day one.
You won’t find any prima donnas here. Our world is full of deadlines that must be met. Stop press is simply not an option. Stress levels inevitably rise as these deadlines approach so you’ll need to be comfortable working under pressure and adept at keeping those plates spinning.
Must-have exposure? Vue.js, PHP (Laravel). For you, software isn’t a job, it’s a craft. You’ve got a GitHub repository. You’re involved in meetups, forums etc. You own a hat and a whip (optional).
Culture is as important to us as it is to you. If you thrive in client-facing environments, enjoy interacting with both technical and non-technical audiences and love nothing more than taking an idea from mere concept to actual implementation then you’ll fit right in.
We’re evolving, pivoting quickly, chucking out stuff that doesn’t work. We’re surrounded by coffee shops so we’ll be brainstorming in those.
And the £££ isn’t your usual startup peanuts. We are looking at up to £65,000 plus benefits.

About RedCloud
Open Commerce, RedCloud, and a $31TN race to market
Our mission is to grow global online commerce for the world’s small businesses by removing the barriers to online trading for hundreds of millions of independent retailers and their suppliers across the world’s supply chains. Despite the growth in e-commerce, less than 3% of B2B trading is made online, and yet, FMCG is Largest Product Category in the world - this is a $30tn business in emerging markets with over 1 million manufacturers, 20m distributors and wholesalers and finally over 500m independent retailers, who are the vital route to market serving over 7bn people every day.
When we ask independent retailers why they don’t trade online with FMCG brands, “we don’t know where to even start” is one of the top reasons we hear. That’s because selling, buying, and paying across B2B supply chains is long, complicated, and fragmented; Payments and purchasing are deeply manual, independent retailers have limited visibility on new products and sales opportunities, and FMCG’s (particularly up and coming brands) find it very difficult to reach new retailers and distributors and set up a rapid go to market. Due to antiquated payments networks, and the high cost of payment processing, over 19tn of trade payments are made offline, adding an enormous burden to online trading, with a 500m+ stores that function every day as powerful outlets for consumer brands, directly influence >80% of local consumer buying behaviour but they are often the least technically equipped with data, pricing, or the latest inventory.
The rapidly growing number of new brands, the rise of the middle-class consumer, and the growth in entrepreneurship has driven the need for a new kind of commerce dynamic, accessing key payment and sales points to enable FMCG’S, Distributors and sellers to trade smarter. So we built an Open Commerce Platform that enables the sale and distribution of FMCG products to be made much simpler. Products should be in front of sellers fast, in real-time, through an immersive commerce experience, with trade buyers and sellers able to see live commerce opportunities and pricing. We have built a digital ecosystem that is specifically designed to unlock the full value of the distribution network, providing real-time visibility for order and inventory management. Our innovative platform provides brands and distributors with deep data insights into buyer trends and behaviour and helps identify opportunities for upselling and cross-selling products.

But it doesn’t stop there, for us to be able to receive orders we integrate with online marketplaces (like Amazon, Ebay, Wayfair, etc) and that’s still only part of the story….. we also maintain the listings of products, stock levels, price changes and adding new products, so our dearly beloved software does a lot!
The main functions are to manage our Warehouse, Fulfilment and Logistics platform from start to finish in a secure environment with the GCP as our bedrock. From inventory management to controlling orders across multiple e-commerce sales channels, the system is the backbone of our company and ensures our global warehouse locations operate at peak performance 24/7.
What’s the team like?
I’d say we are a pretty diverse bunch, who get along together very nicely. We come up with some brilliant ideas on how to solve the businesses issues, almost on a world domination scale at times! When we are not changing the world, we work with some of the latest technologies to design, build and tweak the software so it can become the best in class.
We are passionate about finding solutions to make the process of moving goods around the world as seamless as possible, so our customers and their customers get a great experience. All this commitment requires a little downtime now and again to catch our breath, so our weekly #coffeebreak is a great way to connect both our office and remote workers for ½ hour of fun (sometimes it gets a little competitive) share ideas and find out what’s happening in the team.
The technical bit of your role….
Joining our team as a backend developer will give you the opportunity to work with a wide range of tools and technologies. As a growing technology focused company, we are always looking to evaluate and use the best tools for the job, so we welcome people who are enthusiastic about our current tech stack and relish the idea of learning new technologies & techniques within their role.
Our primary backend services are written in PHP (7 & 8) using the Laravel framework, to provide REST APIs for our frontend team to consume within our Angular frontend. You will have the opportunity to tackle interesting and complex problems, in a bid to produce fast and reliable software that processes hundreds of thousands of orders a month.
Specific parts of our backend have been broken out into microservices written in Golang, this has enabled us to provide narrow focused and performant task processing as part of our wider APIs.
The backend team is also responsible for maintaining our Public API written in NodeJS and Typescript and used by lots of companies to help build out the app store ecosystem that grows the platform in new directions.
Within your role you will deploy code into a modern cloud-based environment with a full featured CI/CD system. We make heavy use of Docker and deploy all our services into Google Cloud using Kubernetes and Helm charts. Our APIs are backed by a fully managed MySQL database and make use of many emerging cloud native technologies such as data warehousing tools, caching services and comprehensive cloud monitoring systems.
The Stack…
The technologies and tools we rely on are:
· PHP (Laravel) – Most of our core system.
· JS (Angular) – Frontend, IOS & Android apps
· GCP – for most of our infrastructure
· GO & NodeJS – Microservices
· Kubernetes – to schedule and run our services
· Docker – for local development
· MySQL – Primary DB
· Elasticsearch – Search & Paging
Think this may be you?
A software engineer at heart and you’re comfortable writing software to solve problems, with an interest in distributed systems and writing resilient, scalable software.
You are familiar with some of our Platform technologies or specialise in just one part and keen to learn more about new technologies and work within a team dedicated to keeping the wheels turning.
If you have any logistics, warehousing or SaaS experience, that’s a big plus for us.
About us…
At I-Fulfilment we currently have around 150 employees at our location in Christchurch, Dorset. As we speak our new building at Bournemouth Airport is reaching its final stages of completion for us to move to in April 2022. This exciting new office & warehouse has been purpose built to provide a unique working environment. It will have a Barista Station, Gym, Yoga room, Wellbeing room, Breakout areas and an outside viewing platform over the airport with a BBQ area. Next year is a very exciting time for us with not only the software, but with our expansion plans becoming reality. It’s a great time to be involved in shaping our future. We look forward to meeting you.

About RedCloud
Open Commerce, RedCloud, and a $31TN race to market
Our mission is to grow global online commerce for the world’s small businesses by removing the barriers to online trading for hundreds of millions of independent retailers and their suppliers across the world’s supply chains. Despite the growth in e-commerce, less than 3% of B2B trading is made online, and yet, FMCG is Largest Product Category in the world - this is a $30tn business in emerging markets with over 1 million manufacturers, 20m distributors and wholesalers and finally over 500m independent retailers, who are the vital route to market serving over 7bn people every day.
When we ask independent retailers why they don’t trade online with FMCG brands, “we don’t know where to even start” is one of the top reasons we hear. That’s because selling, buying, and paying across B2B supply chains is long, complicated, and fragmented; Payments and purchasing are deeply manual, independent retailers have limited visibility on new products and sales opportunities, and FMCG’s (particularly up and coming brands) find it very difficult to reach new retailers and distributors and set up a rapid go to market. Due to antiquated payments networks, and the high cost of payment processing, over 19tn of trade payments are made offline, adding an enormous burden to online trading, with a 500m+ stores that function every day as powerful outlets for consumer brands, directly influence >80% of local consumer buying behaviour but they are often the least technically equipped with data, pricing, or the latest inventory.
The rapidly growing number of new brands, the rise of the middle-class consumer, and the growth in entrepreneurship has driven the need for a new kind of commerce dynamic, accessing key payment and sales points to enable FMCG’S, Distributors and sellers to trade smarter. So we built an Open Commerce Platform that enables the sale and distribution of FMCG products to be made much simpler. Products should be in front of sellers fast, in real-time, through an immersive commerce experience, with trade buyers and sellers able to see live commerce opportunities and pricing. We have built a digital ecosystem that is specifically designed to unlock the full value of the distribution network, providing real-time visibility for order and inventory management. Our innovative platform provides brands and distributors with deep data insights into buyer trends and behaviour and helps identify opportunities for upselling and cross-selling products.
